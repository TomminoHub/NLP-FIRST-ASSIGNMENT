Overload is a bi-monthly professional computer magazine published by ACCU, that was established in 1993 and is edited by Frances Buontempo. It aims to "publish a high standard of articles about all aspects of software development".[1] All issues of Overload, starting from August 1998, are available online.[2]
Overload was started in 1993 as a magazine of the "Turbo C++ SIG".[3] By 1994, it had become a "journal of C++ SIG", with an appropriate change in scope. At that time there were several magazines with similar scope, including C/C++ Users Journal, C++ Report, and to a lesser extent, Dr. Dobb's Journal. The scope of Overload continued to be broadened[4] and in 2000 the magazine was relabeled from "journal of C++ SIG" to "journal of ACCU".[5] About the same time, a board of "readers" was established, to assist authors with improving their articles.[4]
Over time, many competing publications have been discontinued (C++ Report has been discontinued in 2002, C/C++ Users Journal in 2006, Dr Dobbs Journal in 2009),[6] and by 2010 Overload has become the only magazine to cover this area,[citation needed] which has attracted articles of notable writers such as former contributing editor of C/C++ Users Journal Matthew Wilson[7] and creator of C++ Bjarne Stroustrup.[8]
Since its establishment, the scope of the magazine has evolved from issues specific to C/C++ into all aspects of software development, with a particular emphasis on Agile software development.[9][10] In 2005 Overload published a Quality Manifesto by Tom Gilb.
