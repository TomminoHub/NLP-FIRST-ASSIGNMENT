MMO Games Magazine (formerly Massive Magazine)[1] was a short-lived computer magazine that focused on the massively multiplayer online gaming market. It was published by the media conglomerate theGlobe.com as a sister publication to Computer Games magazine.[1] The magazine's website was launched in June 2006, and the first issue hit newsstands that September.[1][2] In January 2007 the magazine began to be published quarterly.[1] Despite the build-up, only three issues went to press. In March 2007, theGlobe.com was forced to cease operation of its print media, including MMO Games, as a result of an unfavorable ruling in a spam lawsuit.[3]
