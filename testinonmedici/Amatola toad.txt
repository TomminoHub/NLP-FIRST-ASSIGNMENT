The Amatola toad (Vandijkophrynus amatolicus) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to the Eastern Cape province, South Africa, where it is known from the Winterberg and Amathole Mountains.[1][2][3] The specific name refers to the type locality, "Amatola Range, near Hogsback".[2][4]
Amatola toads are small toads, with females reaching 38 mm (1.5 in) in snout–vent length. The dorsum is usually uniform dark grey or olive-brown with a distinct, pale, vertebral stripe. Parotoid glands are well developed. There are numerous small, flattened warts on the dorsal surface. The tadpoles are brown in colour.[3][4]
Its natural habitats are high-altitude moist grasslands. Reproduction takes place in shallow temporary pools and seepages,[1] including pools formed in vehicle tracks.[3]
The species is known to congregate in large numbers to breed. However, it was not observed in 1998–2009 despite numerous searches, and the species was feared to be extinct.[1] In 2011, an adult female and many tadpoles were again discovered, on a site that had been searched before. Detection seems to require suitable weather, i.e., heavy rains that trigger breeding.[3]
The main threats to Amatola toad are loss of grassland through afforestation, overgrazing, and fires.[1] Forestry vehicle use during the breeding season can be detrimental to the tadpoles and breeding adults.[3]
