Brookesia peyrierasi is a species of diminutive chameleon, a lizard in the family Chamaeleonidae. The species is endemic to north-eastern Madagascar.  It is known commonly as Peyrieras's pygmy chameleon, named after the herpetologist André Peyriéras.[2]
A 1999 paper in the Journal of Zoology disputed a 1995 paper which considered this species and B. tuberculata to be the same species as B. minima.  The later paper discussed the same details as the first – subtle morphological differences in the hemipenises of the respective species and determined they were not conspecific.  They also found differences in the arrangement of head crests and in minute spines above the eyes.[3]
The natural habitat of B. peyrierasi is forest.[1]
B. peyrierasi is oviparous.[4]
