Francis Joins the WACS is a 1954 American black-and-white comedy film from Universal-International, produced by Ted Richmond, directed by Arthur Lubin and starring Donald O'Connor, Julie Adams, ZaSu Pitts, Mamie Van Doren and Chill Wills in two roles, including that of the distinctive voice of Francis in voice-over.
This is the fifth film in Universal-International's Francis the Talking Mule series.[3]
A computer error mistakenly assigns junior officer Peter Stirling to the Women's Army Corps. Peter's old friend Francis helps him through his various military and personal problems, including several familiar stays in the base's psychiatric ward.
The film is noteworthy for Chill Wills appearing on screen as General Ben Kaye and interacting with Francis, who talks to him in order to get Peter out of trouble.
Donald O'Connor's contract with Universal had expired, so there was some doubt that he would reprise his role before he agreed to make another film.[4]
Leonard Goldstein did not return as producer, being replaced by Ted Richmond.[4]
Although Francis Joins the WACS was announced in late 1952, filming did not start until February 1954.[5]
According to Variety the film outgrossed the second, third and fourth in the Francis series.[6]
Universal released all seven Francis films as a set on three Region 1 and Region 4 DVDs, Francis the Talking Mule: The Complete Collection.
