Chalcides ebneri, also known commonly as Ebner's cylindrical skink, is a species of lizard in the family Scincidae. The species is endemic to Morocco.[1]
The specific name, ebneri, is in honor of Austrian entomologist Richard Ebner (1885â€“1961).[3]
C. ebneri is only found in two small locations and has not been sighted since 1970. It is threatened by some agricultural practices and habitat loss, and populations presumably continue to decline.[1]
C. ebneri is found in rocky areas near grassy ground cover.[1]
The females of C. ebneri give birth to live young,[1] by ovoviviparity.[2]
