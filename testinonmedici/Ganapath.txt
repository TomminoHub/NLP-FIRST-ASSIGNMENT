In a dystopian 2070, the aftermath of a destructive war has left the world divided by a towering wall. On one side resides the affluent elite in a silver city led by the enigmatic Dalini, while on the other, the impoverished struggle for basic necessities.
Guddu, a denizen of the silver city, unwittingly becomes a pawn in Dalini's schemes, recruiting fighters from the poor side for ruthless ring battles. His life takes a dark turn when falsely accused of an affair, leading to a perilous encounter that leaves him buried alive. Rescued by his friend Kaizad, Guddu receives guidance to seek out Shiva, a mysterious figure with unparalleled fighting skills.
As Guddu embraces his newfound identity as Ganapath, he discovers Shiva is more than a mentor – he is the legendary savior Ganapath. United by a common cause, Ganapath and his allies, including the formidable Jassi, rise against Dalini's oppressive regime. They rally the oppressed, inspiring a rebellion that spreads beyond the walls of the silver city.
The climactic battles unfold in the very arena where exploitation once reigned. Ganapath faces off against Dalini's champions, symbolizing the struggle for justice and equality. The silver city witnesses a seismic shift as dissent grows, culminating in a final showdown between Ganapath and Dalini himself.
With Dalini defeated, the walls crumble, marking the dawn of a new era. Ganapath emerges as a beacon of hope, leading the charge to rebuild a society that values compassion over cruelty. His journey from unwitting accomplice to the savior of the oppressed becomes a legend, reminding us that even in the darkest times, the fight for justice can spark a revolution.

Ganapath was panned by critics upon release. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film with 1.5/5 stars and wrote "Ganapath is painfully pea-brained pulp that makes a meal of a terribly thin storyline. It struggles to shore itself up with the aid of utterly vacuous, glaringly hackneyed means that are never in with a chance to get the job done."[23] Bhavna Agarwal of India Today rated the film with 1.5/5 stars and wrote "'Ganapath' offers absolutely no respite. If you expect it to get better in the second half, as Gen Z are often heard saying ‘you are in delulu’."[24]
Sonal Pandya of Times Now rated the film with 1.5/5 stars and wrote "Tiger Shroff goes from loafer to leader in this pointless origin story".[25] Hiren Kotwani of Mid-Day rated the film with 1.5/5 stars and wrote "What makes Ganapath different from the saviour-hero films of yore is that director Bahl has tried to make it look like the desi Mad Max of sorts, albeit with unimpressive design and poor packaging".[26]
Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film with 1/5 stars and wrote "What comes as a surprise is just how terrible this film is, with practically no redeeming feature in its nearly two and half hours run-time."[27] Swetha Ramakrishnan of OTT Play rated the film with 1.5/5 stars and wrote "Ganapath is a dated Hindi film with an identity crisis.[28]
Anuj Kumar of The Hindu review suggests that Ganapath struggles to live up to its potential, despite Tiger Shroff's action and dance skills, due to a weak storyline and execution. The film's lack of logic and mediocrity in various aspects contribute to its shortcomings.[29]
