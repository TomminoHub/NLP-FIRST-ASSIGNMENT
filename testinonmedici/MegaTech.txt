MegaTech (sometimes styled with the katakana メガテケ) was a publication from EMAP aimed specifically at the Sega Mega Drive gaming market. The magazine was started in 1991.[1][2] The launch editorial consisted of a small team including Paul Glancey (editor) and Mark Patterson (deputy editor). It was published monthly.[3] In 1993 the magazine was acquired by Maverick Magazines.[1] It ceased publication in 1994 when it was merged into Mega magazine.[2]
Founding editor Paul Glancey spoke about the magazine's difficult launch, evolution and eventual closure, in a 2022 retrospective article, The MegaTech story: An oral history.
