The Infernal Names is a compiled list of adversarial or antihero figures from mythology intended for use in Satanic ritual. The following names are as listed in The Satanic Bible (1969), written by Church of Satan founder Anton Szandor LaVey.[1] When calling the names, all of them may be recited, or a given number of those most significant to the respective working may be chosen.[2]
Not all were demons in their source culture; this list represents LaVey's interpretation of them and is presented below as they were written in the Satanic Bible, and therefore is prone to historical errors and personal misconceptions.[editorializing]
