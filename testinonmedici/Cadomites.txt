Cadomites is an extinct ammonite genus from the superfamily Stephanoceratoidea that lived during the Middle Jurassic (upper Bajocian â€“ lower Callovian).[1]
Cadomites is directly descended from Stephanoceras, with a similar collared and lipped aperture rim, but has denser, finer, sharper ribbing. The shell is discoidal, evolute, with a wide umbilicus. The suture is complex.
Fossils of species within this genus have been found in the Middle Jurassic sediments in Europe, Africa and South Asia.[2]
