FCW (launched as Federal Computer Week) is a news website that covers U.S. federal government technology and occasionally state, local, tribal and international governments. It is owned by GovExec.
FCW was established in 1987 by International Data Group[1] as a weekly print magazine[2] headquartered in Vienna, Virginia.[3] By 2003, it was part of FCW Media Group.[2]
Its ownership passed to California-based 1105 Government Information Group, a privately held company backed by two private equity firms: Nautic Partners  and Alta Communications.[4] Editor Christopher Dorobek resigned in August 2008 to accept a position at WFED.[5] In December 2008, David Rapp, formerly an executive with Congressional Quarterly, became the publication's new editor (and editorial director overseeing all 1105 GovInfo publications).[6]
In 2021, 1105 sold FCW and several sister publications to GovExec.[7]
