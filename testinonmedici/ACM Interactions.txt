First published in 1994, Interactions initially appeared quarterly, and moved to bi-monthly in 1996.  Since 2000, SIGCHI –  ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction –  has included a subscription to Interactions among its benefits of membership.
Interactions is the third largest ACM publication, and receives the second most citations, according to an article by new editors Wakkary and Stolterman in SIGCHI 2011.[2][3]
Each issue contains a cover story, regarded as the keynote article. Forums are published three times a year by specific Forum Editors, contributing a perspective such as sustainability or public policy. Blogspots are opinionated personal pieces, The Demo Hour segments represent a glimpse at a specific project, and Day in the Lab articles feature labs across the globe.[4]
Finally, the majority of each issue is contained in (typically) 5-6 feature articles, describing issues of general importance to the HCI community.[5]
