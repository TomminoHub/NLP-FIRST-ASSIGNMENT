Noah Shachtman is an American journalist, and musician. He is the editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone.[1] From 2018 to 2021, he served as the editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast.[2] He previously was the executive editor of the site.[3] A former non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, he also worked as executive editor for News at Foreign Policy and as a contributing editor at Wired.[4][5]
Born to a Jewish family, Shachtman graduated from Georgetown University and attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[6] His grandfather was theater impresario Lee Guber, and his father and stepmother worked at CBS News.[7]
In 2003, Shachtman founded Defensetech.org. The site was acquired by Military.com the following year.[8] In 2006, he became a contributing editor at Wired. He co-founded the Danger Room blog, which won the 2007 Online Journalism Award for Beat Reporting[9] and the 2012 National Magazine Award for reporting in digital media.
Shachtman left Wired to join Foreign Policy in 2013. He joined The Daily Beast as its new executive editor in 2014.[10] He helped turned the site into "a journalistic scoop factory", in the words of the Poynter Institute.[11]
When John Avlon left The Daily Beast in May 2018, Shachtman was promoted to editor-in-chief.[12] The Hollywood Reporter named Shachtman one of the 35 most powerful people in New York media in 2019.[13]
Shachtman was named editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone in July 2021.[14][better source needed]"[1][15] After a year under Shachtman as editor-in-chief, Rolling Stone's web traffic was up 18%, its social following up 50%, and its audience had grown considerably younger, with 63% under the age of 44.[16]
Shachtman has contributed to The New York Times Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Slate, and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.[16][17] He has also appeared as a guest on CNN,[18] NPR,[19] MSNBC, and Frontline.[20][21] Shachtman has spoken before audiences at West Point, the Army Command and General Staff College,[22] the Aspen Security Forum,[23] the O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference,[24] Harvard Law School,[25] Yale Law School,[26] National Defense University and the Center for a New American Security Conference.[27]
Shachtman has reported from Afghanistan, Israel, Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait, Russia, the Pentagon, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.[28] Prior to his career in journalism, Shachtman was a campaign staffer in the Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign, a book editor, and plays bass guitar.[29]
On February 27, 2020, journalist Carson Griffith announced she was suing Shachtman, The Daily Beast, and writer Maxwell Tani, over a "defamatory and untruthful" article that contains allegations of offensive workplace comments from her former co-workers and former Gawker writers Maya Kosoff and Anna Breslaw.[30] On March 24, 2021, a New York Supreme Court judge denied a motion by The Daily Beast, Shachtman and Tani to dismiss Griffith's defamation lawsuit. "This Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pled a cause of action for defamation", Justice Phillip Hom wrote in the ruling.[31] On August 9, 2022, a New York Supreme Court judge denied a motion by The Daily Beast, Shachtman and Tani pursuant of New York's anti-SLAPP amendment. The lawsuit will now advance towards discovery.[32]
In October, 2022, Rolling Stone broke the news that the FBI had raided the home of ABC News producer James Gordon Meek, but left out the detail that the raid was carried out because of child pornography, instead suggesting that "Meek appears to be on the wrong side of the national-security apparatus" and that the raid had been instigated by the government because of Meek's reporting on national security issues. It was later revealed that the article was originally to include the child pornography details, but Shachtman, who personally knows the accused Meek and is considered friendly with him, had personally intervened to remove the charges and rewrote the article to give it a different spin.[33]
