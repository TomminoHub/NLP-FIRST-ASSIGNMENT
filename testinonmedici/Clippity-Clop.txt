Clippity-Clop is a 1994 children's picture book written and illustrated by Pamela Allen. It is about a little old man and a woman, and their two donkeys, laden down with goods, that won't move.
The protagonists, a little old man and a lady load goods, a parrot, that squawks throughout the story, and a cat, that miaows throughout the story, onto two donkeys. They then attempt to move the donkeys without success. The man ignores the lady's warning and, resorts to using a whip to move his donkey. The donkey doesn't like this, and runs away.[1] The man chases after the donkey,[2] eventually catches it, and entices the donkey to follow him with carrots.[3] The donkey eats so many carrots that the man has to carry it.[4] Meanwhile, the lady, who was left behind, reappears riding her donkey, having tied a carrot to her whip to encourage the donkey to move. She overtakes the man with her donkey happily chasing the carrot, and the cat is also pleased.[5]
