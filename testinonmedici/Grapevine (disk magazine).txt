Grapevine was a disk magazine for the Commodore Amiga[1] published by the demo scene group LSD.[2] The magazine was published from 1991 and 1995.[3] The first eight issues came on a single floppy disk, but as the magazine became more popular and more articles were submitted by its readers, it required two to three disks per issue after that point. The editor of Grapevine was known as Parasite and later PaZZa/LSD. Several co-editors helped with the magazine under PaZZa's guidance, Scud/lsd, Torch/lsd and KenD/lsd. The magazine was originally coded by Monty Python, and then re-coded with a mouse-driven interface later in the series by Shagratt, Fish/lsd, watchman/lsd and other artists regularly made custom art covers for the magazines' title page. Echo/lsd (Graham Gray/Spoon Wizard) and Mub/lsd wrote original music for the background.
Grapevine accepted articles from anyone and about anything. It was mainly a scene mag for those within the scene, so some articles would have made little sense to outsiders. Nonetheless, it was widely well received. [3] PaZZa's musings were usually a tongue-in-cheek look at everything and anything and usually ended in the disclaimer "all spelling mistakes copyright me!"
An attempt was made in 2005 to revive Grapevine in the form of a web-based magazine. However, this was done unofficially by a group not connected to the original, known as Ellesdee.
The usage of the original disk magazine's name, as well as Ellesdee being a corruption of the original creator's name (LSD), brought strong criticism from other members of the demo scene, including the original team.[4] Some original LSD members were approached for permission to start the revival project and the first issues contained submissions from KenD/LSD.
The revival website, as well as that of Ellesdee, was subsequently shut down.
