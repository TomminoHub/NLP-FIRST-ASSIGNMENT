SKOAR! was launched in 2003 as a sister publication to Digit in order to cater to more hardcore gamers.[1] The tagline of SKOAR! was "... when it's done".
SKOAR!'s tagline was changed to "India's only gaming magazine" as of 2010 (which may or may not be true as a statement in itself).

The e-magazine was an interactive PDF that was provided on the DVD, which also contains other gaming software such as full games, game demos, videos that are of interest to gamers, wallpapers, and more.
