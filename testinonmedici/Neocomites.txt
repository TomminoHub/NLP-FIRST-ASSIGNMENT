Neocomites is a genus of ammonite from the Lower Cretaceous, Berriasian to Hauterivian,[1] and type genus for the Neocomitidae.[3]
The shell of Neocomites is fairly involute and compressed with flattish  sides; covered with flexuous ribs that branch in small sheaves from faint umbilical tubercles, in some branching again or intercaled further out on the whorls, ending in small oblique bullae in either side of a smooth flat venter. Ribs may cross the venter transversely  on later whorls. Sutures have deep 1st lateral lobes.
Neocomites has a fairly widespread distribution and has been found in such places as central and southern Europe, North Africa, Madagascar, northern India, Borneo, Sumatra, Texas, Mexico, Colombia (Macanal Formation, Eastern Ranges),[4] Peru, and Argentina.[2]
