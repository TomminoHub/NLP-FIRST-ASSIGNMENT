Jalsa is a traditional sport of bull racing associated with the Dhanni cattle breed in the Potohar region of Punjab, Pakistan.[1][2]
Jalsa features a specific form of bull race, where a pair of bulls is harnessed to a panjali (yoke), and a karah (wooden plank) is tied behind them.[1][3] The event involves six individuals: three controlling the bulls and three placing and pressing the karah into soft ground, thus increasing the load the bulls carry.[1][3] The challenge for the bulls is to maintain speed and steadiness under this burden.[3] The winner is determined by the crowd, based on the bull's performance, rather than by an official umpire.[1][3]
The event operates without formal governmental oversight or the presence of police or emergency services.[3] Crowd control is managed by the event organizers, who initially request cooperation from disruptive attendees and may resort to throwing dust as a form of non-violent deterrent if necessary.[3]
Jalsa is a long-standing tradition in Chakwal, continuing to be held despite the influence of modern cultural changes in the region.[3]
