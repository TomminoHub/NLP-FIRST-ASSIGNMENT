Francis in the Navy is a 1955 American black-and-white comedy film from Universal-International, produced by Stanley Rubin and directed by Arthur Lubin. The film stars Donald O'Connor and Martha Hyer, and marked the first credited film role of Clint Eastwood.[1] The distinctive voice of Francis is a voice-over by actor Chill Wills.
This is the sixth film in Universal-International Francis the Talking Mule series.[2]
U.S. Army officer Lt. Peter Sterling gets mistaken for his lookalike in the U.S. Navy, Bosun's Mate 'Slicker' Donevan, and as a result gets promptly shipped to Donevan's base. With his old pal Francis, Sterling continues his military career misadventures, this time in the Navy.
Donald O'Connor was reluctant to make the film but agreed to do one more at the request of his daughter[3] (in addition to a financial inducement from Universal studio head Edward Muhl).[4]
It was once known as Francis Weighs Anchor and started filming February 15, 1955.[5]
The film was partially shot at the U. S. Navy base in Coronado California, not far from downtown San Diego.[6]
Stanley Rubin was producer on the film.[7]
