Tap! was a magazine for owners of Appleâ€™s iOS devices (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch), published by Future plc. It was established by Christopher Phin[1] and was a sister title to MacFormat.
The magazine selected and reviewed apps and games from the App Store as well as a range of hardware accessories for iOS devices. There were tutorials on getting the most from your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch, getting started help for those who are new to the platform, and a small section that gives best practice and technical advice to iOS developers.
The last issue of the magazine was published in August 2013.
