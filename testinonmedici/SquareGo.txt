SquareGo was an independent publication founded in Scotland in 2006 and publishing until 2015, which reported on video game news, reviews and previews.
SquareGo originated as an offshoot from the digital section of The Skinny. Due to a lack of available space in the magazine's pages, the digital editor of The Skinny, Josh Wilson, started up a spin-off magazine with the aim of providing the digital coverage for the magazine but also with the required space to further cover the Games Industry.
In August 2008, SquareGo separated amicably all business links with The Skinny.
The website appeared online on 10 May 2006 as Fidget Magazine, but by August the name had been changed to SquareGo. The original paper edition of the magazine was published from August 2007 every calendar month until August 2008, featuring wraparound covers varying in subject from titles such as Star Wars: The Force Unleashed to Fallout 3.
In February 2009, SquareGo entered into a distribution deal with retail company Gamestation, to provide copies of the magazine in all Scottish branches of the store [1]
The website took over in earnest after August 2008 and grew exponentially over the years to over 30,000 weekly hits.
The site slowed its article output throughout 2014, and closed for good in March 2015.
In addition to reviews, First Impression, and Hands-On previews, The magazine also regularly publishes several standard types of featured articles.
On 7 November 2010 SquareGo was named Computer and Video Games's Site of the Week.[2]
On 21 July 2011 SquareGo was named the 26th Best Website in Scotland by The List.[3]
