Mini-Micro Systems, a trade magazine,[1] was a computer industry monthly magazine[2] published by Cahners Publishing.[3]
The magazine's Mini-Micro Systems title[4][5] originated in 1976;[6] previously it was named Modern Data.[7][8] Some of their material was picked up by other computer periodicals.[9] Publication of Mini-Micro ceased in 1989.[10]
When computer periodicals were more numerous, The New York Times noted that the 1968-originated Modern Data title benefited from both a change in title and that they successfully "homed in exclusively on the mushrooming small computer field."[2]
