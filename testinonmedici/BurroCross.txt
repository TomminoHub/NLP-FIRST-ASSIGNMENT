BurroCross is self-reliant (unsupported) backcountry travel on foot (hiking or backpacking) in the company of a burro (Equus africanus asinus[1][2]) where, similar to Overlanding the experience of the journey itself is the principle objective. (Unlike Overlanding, BurroCross is non-mechanized travel that relies on the capabilities of a burro companion and thereby presents an entirely new skill focus required for the journey.) BurroCross is a non-competitive sport or recreational activity that proceeds at a walking pace and is centered on utilizing the overland capabilities of burros for companionship and sharing the burden of carrying the gear necessary to sustain the journey. The burro and the person progress through the journey and the experience as a team, side-by-side, therefore the burro is not ridden. The term "BurroCross" is a unique play on words that combines "burro" with the notion of cross-country travel, and it is also a nod to the familiar cross-shaped marking down the back and across the shoulders of most burros.
BurroCross can be done as a solo activity (one person, one burro) or as a group of person / burro pairs. Multiple burros may be used in a string, but usually no more than 2 per person is necessary or desirable. A BurroCross outing can take the form of a day hike, but generally multi-day excursions are preferable with BurroCross thru-hiking or section-hiking regarded as the pinnacle achievement of the sport.
BurroCross must be carried out with a burro (donkey). If any other animal is used (including a horse or mule), it is not BurroCross. The burro may be of any size (mini, standard, or mammoth[3]) but generally the standard size is preferred due to its ability to carry the necessary weight as well as its comparatively low maintenance needs on the trail. Burros can be of domestic or formerly wild origin (referred to as BLM Burros in the United States[4]).
Because the journey is to be enjoyed by both burro and person alike in BurroCross, sharing the burden is also a key component of the sport; which differentiates it from packing, trekking, or the historic use of burros as beasts of burden. The person will normally carry their own personal items in a backpack (clothing, electronics, etc.) and the burro will normally carry the general camp items (tent, sleeping bag, food, etc.), extra water, and its own provisions and gear. Crossing country on foot with a pack burro in tow is not a new endeavor per se, as burros have been relied upon for centuries to carry supplies and lighten the load of workers and travelers alike, but it is a fairly new undertaking in the recreational sense, where nowadays burros are just as valued for their affable companionship as they are for their load-bearing capacity and sure-footed capability over rough terrain. BurroCross is enhanced by the technological advancements that have incorporated the use of durable and ultralight materials into backpacking gear and promotes the same application of technology to pack gear. With BurroCross, gone are the days of canvas tents and Dutch ovens in favor of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene composite fabrics and 3-oz fuel-efficient stoves. A key ethic of BurroCross is the burro as a companion rather than as a worker, therefore the gear selection and how it is shared between the person and the burro is a key consideration. There are many online and published resources for light and ultralight backpacking gear that can be referenced to outfit a BurroCross adventure.
BurroCross embraces the following key ethics, each held as equally important to the other:
