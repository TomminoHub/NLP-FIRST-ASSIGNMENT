The driver of a horse-drawn carriage fell asleep in his vehicle. While he was asleep, a group of people, jokingly took his horses and replaced them with a donkey. The driver is woken up by the passenger and is flabbergasted by the change.[1]
Cabman's Adventure was written and directed by Kazimierz Prószyński. It was filmed by him in 1902 in Warsaw, Congress Poland, with a biopleograph, a filming device invented by Prószyński. The film was produced by his company, Towarzystwo Udziałowe Pleograf. It was an experimental film and one of the first films made by him.[2][3] The film features two characters, a passager played by Kazimierz Junosza-Stępowski, and a cabman, whose actor's name remains uncertain, though it is presumed to be Władysław Neubelt. It was the film debut of Junosza-Stępowski.[4] The film was released in September 1902. It is one of the two oldest known films made in Poland, with the other being The Return of a Merry Fellow, also made in 1902.[2]
