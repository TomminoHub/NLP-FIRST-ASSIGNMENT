The Romagnolo or Asino Romagnolo is a breed of donkey from Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy.[3][4] It is raised mainly in the province of Forl√¨-Cesena, but also the provinces of Metropolitan City of Bologna, and the provinces of Ravenna and Reggio Emilia.[2] It is one of the eight autochthonous donkey breeds of limited distribution recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.[3] The conservation status of the Romagnolo was listed as "critical" by the FAO in 2007.[1]
