Custom PC (usually abbreviated to 'CPC') was a UK-based computer magazine originally published by Dennis Publishing Ltd and subsequently sold to Raspberry Pi Trading Ltd. It was aimed at PC hardware enthusiasts, covering topics such as modding, overclocking, and PC gaming. The first issue was released in October 2003 and it was published monthly until the final issue, number 235, was released in February 2023.  
In February 2023 the magazine ceased printed production and the brand name and content rights were sold to Network N Media who relaunched the brand as an online-only entity CustomPC.com. [1]
Audited circulation figures for the magazine were 9,428[2] (ABC, Janâ€“Dec 2014). Gareth Ogden retired as editor of Custom PC at the end of Issue 52. Issue 53 was edited by Deputy Editor James Gorbold; from Issue 54 onwards the magazine was edited by Alex Watson. From Issue 87 to Issue 102 the magazine was edited by James Gorbold. From Issue 103 onward, the magazine has been edited by Ben Hardwidge.
Between 2009 and January 2012, the magazine was partnered with enthusiast site bit-tech.net, with the two editorial teams merging and sharing resources across both the site and the magazine.[3] Custom PC's James Gorbold took over as Group Editor of the two teams. However, since February 2012, the two brands have separated and content is no longer shared between the two publications, although many of the magazine's writers continue to write for bit-tech.
In February 2019 the magazine, along with Digital SLR Photography Magazine, was sold to Raspberry Pi Trading, a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.[4]
Issue 235 in February 2023 became the final issue available in printed format.
The magazine includes reviews, features, tutorials, analysis columns and sections devoted to magazine readers. The most current regular sections includes:
Anyone who subscribes currently receives a free tool kit or another freebie such as a custompc mug or recently (28 January 2011) a Muc-off Screen Cleaning Rescue Kit, targeted at computer maintenance.[6] Subscribers receive a Special Subscriber Edition which features exclusive artwork (usually the "flat-out coolest" photo from the cover shoot,[7] according to Alex Watson).
