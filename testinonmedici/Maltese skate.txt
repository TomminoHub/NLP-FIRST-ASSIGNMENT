The Maltese skate (Leucoraja melitensis), or Maltese ray, is a species of fish in the family Rajidae. It is a rare endemic species from the Mediterranean Sea[2] found in the coastal waters of Algeria, Italy, Malta, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey. Its natural habitat is open seas. It is threatened by habitat loss.
In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Maltese skate (Leucoraja melitensis) to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."[3]
