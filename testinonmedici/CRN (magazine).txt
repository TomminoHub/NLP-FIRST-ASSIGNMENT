CRN is an American computer magazine. It was first launched as Computer Retail Week on June 7, 1982, as a magazine targeted to computer resellers.[1] It soon after was renamed Computer Reseller News.
Originally launched in 1982 and published by CMP Media of Manhasset, New York, United States,[1] CRN was subsequently purchased by London-based United Business Media (UBM) as part of the $920 million acquisition of CMP. Computer Reseller News later changed its name to the acronym CRN and is still published today by franchise publishers in a number of other countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, India, Poland, Russia,[2] the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Australian CRN is published by nextmedia,[3] the UK version of CRN was published by Incisive Media for some years after it acquired VNU Business Publications UK in 2007[4] and the U.S. version is published by The Channel Company which acquired UBM Channel under management buyout from UBM in 2013.[5]
The headquarters of the magazine is in Westborough, Massachusetts.[6] In 2009 CRN's U.S. version was recognized as a leading advertising medium for the IT industry by B2B's Media Power 50 ranking, which called it the "unrivaled leader in covering the channel".[7]
In January 2012, the UK version of CRN launched the CRN Sales and Marketing Awards. These awards recognise and reward the achievements of high-achieving information and communications technology companies.[8]
In April 2022, The Channel Company acquired CRN UK, Computing, and Channel Partner Insight from Incisive Media. This deal reunited the UK and US edition of CRN under common ownership.[9]
