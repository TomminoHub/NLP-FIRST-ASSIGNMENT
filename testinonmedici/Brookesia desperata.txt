Brookesia desperata is a species of chameleons. It is endemic to Foret d'Ambre Special Reserve in north Madagascar, and is a critically endangered species due to the decline of its habitat. This decline is attributed to clearance of forest for crops, charcoal production, timber extraction, small-scale quarrying and cattle grazing.[1] It was named desperata to provoke thought regarding the desperately threatened habitat of Madagascar's micro-endemic species. They can be found roosting above ground on small branches or leaves 5-100 cm above ground at night.[2] B. Desperata was discovered in 2012 by a research team led by Dr. Frank Glaw from the Zoologische Staatssammlung MÃ¼nchen.[3]
