The film is based on the real story of Sarita Devi who was born to a poor family in the district of Manipur. She gained prominence after winning a bronze medal at the World Championship held in 2005. She was also bestowed upon with the Arjuna award for her achievements.[1][4]
The film starts from the 2014 Asian Games which was held in Incheon, South Korea where Sarita Devi won the third place in the championship but refused to accept her bronze medal in protest after a controversial loss to host Korea's Park Ji-Na. AIBA later suspended her from Manipur for the disrespectful act. She also got banned for one year.[5]
