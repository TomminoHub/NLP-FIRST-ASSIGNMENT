Amiga Active was a monthly computer magazine published by Pinprint Publishing, it launched at a time when most other Amiga magazines had already closed, and as a result only had one major competitor: Amiga Format. A large proportion of the Amiga Active staff were from CU Amiga Magazine, which had closed the previous year. In total 26 issues were published, the first in October 1999,[1] and the last in November 2001. The closure of Amiga Active ended the news-stand distribution of UK Amiga magazines after almost 14 years.
