Nativity is a c.1380 tempera and gold on panel painting by Simone dei Crocifissi, now the only 14th century Bolognese work in the Uffizi in Florence.[1] It is signed "Simon" and – stylistically close to another Nativity (Davia Bargellini Collection, Bologna) – it belongs to the painter's mature period.[2]
