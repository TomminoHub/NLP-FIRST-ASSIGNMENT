PC Ace was a partwork magazine published by Eaglemoss Publications, between 1999 and 2001. It was aimed at those aged between 10 and 14, providing information on how to operate a personal computer. Readers of the magazine were assisted in part by a cartoon mouse named Ace, who featured throughout the magazine's pages.[1]
The series consisted of 100 parts, and was previously available for sale in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, among others.
PC Ace was released on a weekly basis, with a CD-ROM accompanying the magazine every second issue (with the exception of part 1, which included two CD-ROM discs). These CD-ROM discs contained programs such as computer games and edutainment titles.
Issues that included a CD-ROM did not include the Wordpower section.
PC Ace was divided into 9 sections,[2] detailed below.
