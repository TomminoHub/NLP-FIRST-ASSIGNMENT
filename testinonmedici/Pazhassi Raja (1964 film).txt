Pazhassi Raja is a 1964 Malayalam biographical film, directed and produced by Kunchako. It is written by well known playwright Thikkodiyan and is based on the life of warrior king Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja. It stars Kottarakkara Sreedharan Nair in the title role, with Prem Nazir, Sathyan, Satyapal, S. P. Pillai, Rajashree and Pankajavalli in other important roles.[1]
Pazhassi Raja is the second historical film in Malayalam, the first one was Veluthamby Dalava (1962) by the same director.[1] Pazhassi Raja was completely filmed from Kunchako's Udaya Studios, which resulted in the lack of technical perfection and eventually lead to the commercial failure of the film.[1] Its music is composed by R. K. Shekhar, who debuted as a music director through this film. 
The film features an acclaimed musical score and the soundtrack by R. K. Shekhar. It was his debut work, though he has worked in a lot of films as a conductor or as an uncredited music director. The songs became popular upon release and established a bright career for Shekhar. The soundtrack consists of 12 songs with lyrics by Vayalar Ramavarma.
"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare" (by K. J. Yesudas), "Muthe Vaa Vaavo Muthu Kudame Vaa Vvaavo" (by P. Susheela), "Saayippe Saayippe, Aslam Alaikkum" (by P. Leela and Mehboob), "Kannu Randum Thaamarappoo" (by P. Susheela) and "Paathira Poovukal Vaarmudikettil" (by P. Leela) are considered evergreen hits.[1]
