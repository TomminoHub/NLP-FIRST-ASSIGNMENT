MacLife (stylized as Mac|Life) is an American monthly magazine published by Future US. It focuses on the Macintosh personal computer and related products, including the iPad and iPhone. It was sold as a print product on newsstands, but is now exclusively a digital–only product distributed through Magazines Direct, or through the Mac|Life app which can be obtained via the App Store. Between September 1996 and February 2007, the magazine was known as MacAddict.
MacLife is one of two successor magazines to the defunct CD-ROM Today. First published in 1993 by Imagine Publishing (now Future US), CD-ROM Today was targeted at both Windows and Macintosh users, and each issue shipped with a CD-ROM of shareware and demo programs. In August 1996, CD-ROM Today ceased publication, with two magazines taking its place: MacAddict for Macintosh users, and boot (now Maximum PC) for Windows users.[2]
As was the case with CD-ROM Today, MacAddict's discs included shareware and demo programs, but also came with other added features, such as staff videos and previews of content inside the magazine's hard copy. The MacAddict website was updated daily with news relevant to Apple products. MacAddict also had a mascot, a stick-figure named Max. By 1998, MacAddict surpassed Macworld as the Macintosh magazine with the highest consumer newsstand spending due to its $7.99 cover price.[3]
In February 2007, MacAddict was relaunched as MacLife.[4][5] The new magazine is physically larger than the old magazine and was focused on the creativity of Mac users, and no longer comes with a CD-ROM.
In April 2023, MacLife issued its last print edition and switched to a digital-only format. The magazine can still be read and enjoyed on a Mac, iPad, iPhone or other non-Apple digital devices.[6]
In Germany, a magazine of the same name but with no association is published by Falkemedia from Kiel (ISSN 1860-9988).
From 1996 to mid-2002, there were four rating icons, which depicted Max. There was "Blech" (the lowest), "Yeah, Whatever" (a mediocre product), "Spiffy" (a solid yet not perfect product), and "Freakin' Awesome" (the highest). From 2002 to 2009, it was replaced with a more conventional five-point system. In 2010, MacLife adopted a 10-point system that included half stars.
