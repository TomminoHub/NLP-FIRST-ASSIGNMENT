Fagesia is a small, subglobular ammonite (suborder Ammonitina) belonging to the vascoceratid family of the Acanthocerataceae that lived during the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous, 92-88 Ma ago.
The shell of Fagesia is about 9.5 cm (3.47 in) in diameter, typically with blunt umbilical tubercles from which spring 2 or three ribs each, but which are lost in the late growth stage. The suture is ammonitic with long spikey lobes and saddles with rounded subelements.
Fossils of Fagesia have been found in Brazil, Colombia (El Colegio, Cundinamarca, La Frontera (Cundinamarca, Huila and Boyacá),[1] and Loma Gorda Formations, Aipe, Huila),[2] Egypt, France, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Romania, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, United States (Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas), and Venezuela.[3]
