Canard PC is an independent magazine founded in France in 2003 devoted to PC gaming and published monthly.[1][2]
The title Canard PC is a paronym, derived from Canard WC, which is the French name for Toilet Duck.
Canard PC's independence from the game companies is recognized in the French video gaming circles.[3][4][5][6] Canard PC has a sister magazine, Canard PC Hardware.[7]
Independent studies have shown that Canard PC reviews many games not mentioned by other magazines or websites specialized in video games, and has a strong variation in its review scores.[8][9] Canard PC Managing editor, Ivan Gaud√©, recognized in a video games critics panel on a French network that they did not like scoring very much, but they felt they had to put them for their reviews because gamers wanted them.[6]
In July 2003, some editors left the publishing staff of the French gaming monthly Joystick after its acquisition by Future Publishing. They founded Canard PC in the following months.[1] The magazine is edited by Presse Non-Stop, a company owned at 75% by the editors themselves, specifically created for Canard PC.
