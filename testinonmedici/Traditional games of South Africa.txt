South Africa has some traditional games.[1]
Some traditional South African games are played annually at the National Indigenous Games Festival in September.[2]
In this game, players stand upright against a wall while opponents try to jump on their back to make them collapse.[3]
In three toti, the goal is to throw a ball at three tin cans that are piled up in a pyramid shape, and then to run back-and-forth between two predetermined points in order to score as many points as possible before the tin cans are re-assembled by the opponents.[4]
Drie stokkies resembles the triple jump event: it involves participants trying to jump three times between three sticks, with the person who can jump the furthest beyond the last stick winning.[5][6]
It is believed that kho-kho arrived in South Africa with the importation of indentured Indian servants by the British.[1]
Dibeke is a game similar to football and dodgeball; in this game, the attacking team attempts to kick a ball down the length of the field in order to score points, while the defending team is allowed to pick up the ball with their hands and throw it at members of the attacking team to eliminate them.[10]
In dithini, players attempt to stack up various tin cans into a predetermined shape, while opponents can eliminate stacking players by hitting them with a ball.[11]
Two players stand on either side of the playing area, and attempt to eliminate players by throwing the ball at them. The last remaining player wins.[12]
