Oxynoticeras is an extinct genus of ammonite from the Early Jurassic[1] of Europe and North America.[2] This genus is characterized by its smooth shell, with almost invisible undulations on the flank, and a sharp keel.[3]
Synonym Oxynotoceras was created by Buckman as misspelling.[4]
Fossils belonging to this genus were found in Europe, Morocco, Asia, Canada, USA and South America.[4]
