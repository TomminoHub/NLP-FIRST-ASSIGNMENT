Ahoy! was a computer magazine published between January 1984 and January 1989 in the US, covering on all Commodore color computers, primarily Commodore 64 and Amiga.
The first issue of Ahoy! was published in January 1984.[1] The magazine was published monthly by Ion International and was headquartered in New York City.[1] It published many games in BASIC and machine language, occasionally also printing assembly language source code. Ahoy! published a checksum program called Flankspeed for entering machine language listings.[citation needed]
Ahoy!'s AmigaUser was a related but separate publication dedicated to the Amiga. It was spun off from a series of columns in Ahoy! with the same title, and the first two issues were published instead of the parent magazine in May and August 1988.
