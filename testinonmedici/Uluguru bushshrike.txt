The Uluguru bushshrike (Malaconotus alius) is a species of rare bird occurring only in the Uluguru Mountains in Morogoro Region of Tanzania. It was discovered in 1926 and was known to be confined to a single site in the Uluguru North Forest Reserve of about 84Â km2. However, in March 2007, a team of Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania discovered its presence in the Uluguru South Forest Reserve in Morogoro Region.[2] There are an estimated 1200 pairs remaining and the population trend is stable.[3]
