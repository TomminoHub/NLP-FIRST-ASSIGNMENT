Computer Zeitung was the first German computer magazine, founded in 1970, and launched at the first CeBIT computer expo.[1]  It was published weekly[2] on Mondays, in the Berliner newspaper format.[citation needed]
The publisher was the Konradin Verlag,[1] with Rainer Huttenloher as the editor-in-chief since 2002.[3][4]
Since October 2009, the homepage of the Computerzeitung is not longer active and redirected to the German magazine Bild der Wissenschaft.
Since December 2010 a new Computerzeitung is available in Switzerland. The monthly magazine is available for free, with about 200,000 units per month.
