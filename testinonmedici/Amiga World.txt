Amiga World was a magazine dedicated to the Amiga computer platform.[1] It was a prominent Amiga magazine, particularly in the United States, and was published by Massachusetts-based IDG Publishing from 1985 until April 1995.[2] The first several issues were distributed before the computer was available for sale to the public. Issue 3 (Vol 2 No 1, January 1986) featured the artist Andy Warhol.[2] The headquarters of the magazine later moved to Peterborough, New Hampshire.[3]
