Computer!Totaal, conveniently abbreviated as C!T, is a Dutch monthly magazine about computers and related subjects. It is the largest computer magazine of the Netherlands.[2]
Originally, C!T was the newsletter of the Hobby Computer Club (HCC) and was called HCC Nieuwsbrief. The magazine was started in 1977.[3] It was renamed to the current name in 1992. On 1 October 2008, IDG and HCC terminated their co-operation. From that date onwards, HCC membership and the HCC Nieuwsbrief subscription were no longer linked.[4]
C!T is published by IDG Nederland and part of IDG's PC World product line.[5]
