TechRadar is owned by Future plc,[7] the sixth-largest publisher in the United Kingdom. In Q4 2017, TechRadar entered the top 100[8] of Similarweb's US Media Publications Rankings as the 93rd biggest media site in the United States.
In 2023, TechRadar underwent a significant redesign, which the company described as a relaunch.[9] The redesign aimed to enhance user navigation, with a shift from story-type to product category-based navigation.

TechRadar Pro, an arm of the main site, is a b2b-focused property with an emphasis on small business. The subbrand "acts as a complementary source of information targeted specifically at businesses and decision makers," the company says.[16] A related property, 5GRadar.com, is focused on the mobile industry.
The newest brand extension – TechRadar Gaming, or TRG – was launched 17 December 2021[17] and aims to "sit at the intersection of hardware and gaming, leveraging strengths of existing brands to bring the best experience to gaming audience." The Editor in Chief is currently Jake Tucker. The company described a related hiring spree for the site as "the biggest investment in gaming in a decade."
