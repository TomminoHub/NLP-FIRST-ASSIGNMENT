Web Hosting Magazine was a web hosting industry print magazine that published from 2000 to 2002.[1] It spawned a companion tradeshow, Web Hosting Expo. Its founders and editors were Dmitri Eroshenko and Isabel Wang. It was published by Infotonics Media.[1] The magazine was written and edited with a deliberately "edgy" style, designed to appeal to the primarily young and male constituency of the ISP industry.[citation needed]
In 2003, Ping! Zine Web Hosting Magazine was launched, based on the concept of Web Hosting Magazine, and Isabel Wang came on board as a main part of the Editorial Board.  This magazine continued with the edgy style.
Web Host Industry Review Magazine (WHIR Magazine) was born out of the need for a more serious hard hitting news and trade publication in the Web Hosting Industry.
