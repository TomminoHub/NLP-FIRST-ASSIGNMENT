XONE (formerly X360) was a monthly magazine produced by Imagine Publishing in the United Kingdom.[1] XONE was the UK's #1 selling independent dedicated Xbox 360 and Xbox One magazine, covering news, previews and reviews. The magazine's community and Xbox Live was also featured heavily in the magazine.
The magazine was originally included as a supplement in the now-defunct Highbury Entertainment publication XBM, but was made a monthly magazine in October 2005, prior to the launch of the Xbox 360. It was Highbury Entertainment's biggest ever launch (known at the time as X-360), with over Â£200k spent on below-the-line marketing.
The magazine is packaged with a DVD featuring game trailers narrated by the XONE team, plus a book usually containing a walkthrough or achievement guide. In October 2013 its original title, X360, was changed to X-ONE with the issue 104.[1]
The magazine ceased publication as of November 2015.
