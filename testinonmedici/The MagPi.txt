The MagPi is the official Raspberry Pi magazine. It started off life as a free[1] fanzine for users of the Raspberry Pi computer. It was created by the community[2][3] as an unofficial volunteer produced Raspberry Pi publication[4] and in 2015 was handed over to the Raspberry Pi Foundation to be run in-house as the official Raspberry Pi magazine.[5] It was launched in May 2012[6] and contains news, projects and tutorials.[7]
Writing in LinuxNov at the time of the launch, Mohamed Hussein considered it to be "really worth" downloading for its informative and helpful content.[8] The first issue was found by Harry Fairhead in I Programmer to be uninspiring, with the lack of hardware available to writers being noted. However, he did consider it to be a "venture worth supporting" in the longer term.[4]
Writing in The Wall Street Journal's Tech Europe blog, Ben Rooney described the magazine as having a "comforting nostalgic feel" but questioned whether this would appeal to a new generation of programmers.[9]
