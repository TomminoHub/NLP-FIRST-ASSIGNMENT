DAD-IS is the acronym of the worldwide Domestic Animal Diversity Information System[1] of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, within FAO's programme on management of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture.[2] It includes a searchable database of information about animal breeds, the Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources. DAD-IS contains information on breed characteristics, uses, geographic distribution and demographics; more than 4,000 images; and tools for generating user-defined reports; and has a multilingual interface and content. It also provides contact information[3] for the National and Regional Coordinators for the Management of Animal Genetic Resources.[4]
Data from DAD-IS is used for reporting on the global status and trends of animal genetic resources, including the data for Indicators 2.5.1b[5] and 2.5.2[6] of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. FAO began to collect data on animal breeds in 1982. The first version of DAD-IS was launched in 1996 and the software has been updated several times. The fourth and latest version of DAD-IS was launched on 21 November 2017.[7]
The data in DAD-IS pertain to 37 different mammalian and avian livestock species. As of September 2022, DAD-IS contained data for 11,555 mammalian and 3,758 avian national breed populations.[8] These national breed populations represent a global total of 8,859 breeds, which include 595 breeds (7%) that are reported to be extinct.[8]  Local breeds (only found in one region) make up 7,739 entries, while 1,071 are transboundary breeds, meaning they are found in more than one region.
Data for populations of honey bees and other bees that are managed for food and agriculture were included in DAD-IS starting in 2020. As of April 2023, data from 59 national populations were available, representing 31 different species and subspecies.
FAO uses the information about population sizes to classify breeds according to risk of extinction. Risk classes are not at risk, vulnerable, endangered, critical and extinct, in order of increasing risk.[9] Approximately 27% (about 2,350) of all DAD-IS breeds are currently classified as being at risk of extinction, although this figure includes those breeds that are already extinct. A further 48% are classified as being of unknown risk status. This percentage represents the breeds that have no reported population data during the past 10 years.[8]
transboundary breeds
Figure 1: Total Number of Livestock Breeds by region. Local and regional transboundary breeds are combined and international transboundary breeds are ones that are found in more than 1 country. Note : Figures exclude extinct breeds. Figures for Alpaca, American bison, deer, dog, dromedary × Bactrian camel, guanaco, llama, vicuña, cassowary, Chilean tinamou, duck × Muscovy duck, emu, guinea fowl, ñandu, peacock, quail and swallow are combined in the “others” category.
