Sqay is a South Asian martial art from Kashmir which involves fighting with a sword and shield.
Nazir Ahmad Mir, a sqay grandmaster, played a significant role in reviving the martial art's popularity; he began promoting sqay from the 1980s onwards in Kashmir, and did international demonstrations in various countries. He eventually started an organisation which helped promote sqay globally.[1][2]
In 2023, the Indian Army's Chinar Corps organized a Sqay session for girls in the Shopian district of Kashmir.[3] Sqay is one of 43 sports to be included in the 2023 National Games of India.[4][5][6]
