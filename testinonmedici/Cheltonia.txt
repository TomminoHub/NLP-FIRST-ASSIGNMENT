Cheltonia is an extinct genus of ammonite from the Upper Sinemurian substage of Lower Jurassic of Europe, Africa,[2] and America.[citation needed] It is probably a microconch of genus Oxynoticeras.[1]
Ammonites belonging to this genus had small platyconic shell, on which the last whorl has been eccentrically coiled. Ventral rostrum could be preceded by 3 to 5 crawlings. Umbilicus took about 30â€”40% of diameter. Ribs were falcoid and weak. Suture has been the same as in the case of young Oxynoticeras.[1]
