The Grigio Siciliano or Asino Ferrante, is a breed of donkey from the Mediterranean island of Sicily in southern Italy.[2] It is bred only on the island,  in the provinces of Agrigento, Enna, Palermo, Ragusa and Syracuse.[3] The conservation status of the Grigio Siciliano was listed as "critical" by the FAO in 2007.[1] In 2012 it was not among the autochthonous donkey breeds of limited distribution recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.[4] A recent census conducted by researchers at the University of Messina counted approximately 100 individuals between 4 months and 14 years old.[3][5]
