The Clown and His Donkey is an 1910 animated short film featuring silhouette animation. It was written, directed, and produced by the British animator Charles Armstrong.[1] It was his third known silhouette animated film, following 
The Sporting Mice(1909) and Votes for Women: A Caricature (1909). The Clown and His Donkey is Armstrong's only surviving film, though he continued directing animated films until 1915.[1]  All of Armstrong's animated films were distributed by the Charles Urban Trading Company.[1]
The film consists of seven scenes, separated by black segments of various lengths. The film depicts a clown and his donkey performing circus tricks, juggling, and playing practical jokes. A circus monkey assists the clown in some scenes. The clown gestures to the audience, asking for its complicity.[1]
The film's silhouettes are white. They are depicted in profile, and contrasted with the film's black background.[1]
In the film, Armstrong animated shadow puppets frame-by-frame. He was pioneering silhouette animation techniques which would later be perfected by Lotte Reiniger.[2]
Charles Armstrong produced his animated films at the Cumberland Works in Kew.[3] The film's depiction of circus acts reflected the status of animation itself in its era. Animation was seen as a novelty and as a form of marginal entertainment.[3]
Armstrong's animated films tended to combine "impossible" scenarios with political satire, reflecting the British political issues of his era. The Clown and His Donkey may be making a "playful social point", but its primary purpose was to demonstrate Armstrong's "technical acumen".[3]
