With a turn of events leading to both sons joining together and take revenge for their mother's death forms the rest of the story.
Archana made her Tamil cinema debut with the film.[2] The film, unlike Balu Mahendra's previous offbeat ventures, was an "outright commercial picture". He later claimed that he made the film to prove his critics that he could make commercial films.[3] Hence he titled the film Neengal Kettavai (What you asked for).[4] A few scenes were shot at the VGP golden beach.[2] The song "Oh Vasantha Raja" was shot at Brihadisvara Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram.[5]
The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.[6][7] The song "Kanavu Kaanum" is based on "Kasme Vaade" from Upkar (1967).[8][9] For the dubbed Telugu version Kodama Simhalu, the lyrics were written by L. Aathma Rao and Rajasri.[10]
Neengal Kettavai was released on 28 June 1984.[11] Kalki caustically commented, "Balu Mahendra, idhaiyaa kettom?" (Balu Mahendra, is this what we asked for? ).[1] Despite the film's box-office success, Mahendra opted to continue making offbeat films.[3]
