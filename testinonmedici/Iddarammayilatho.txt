The Central Minister is facing accusations over possessing black money of ₹1 trillion (equivalent to ₹1.7 trillion or US$21 billion in 2023) and money laundering it into Europe through his unsuspecting daughter Akanksha, a psychology student who goes to Barcelona to pursue higher education. Akanksha finds a diary in her flat in Barcelona, and out of curiosity, she starts reading the book, which unfolds the romantic drama between Sanju Reddy and Komali Sankaraabharanam. Akanksha gets engaged in Paris with her father's henchman Shawar Ali. Incidentally, she runs into Sanju and gets to know him. 
Sanju is an engineer-turned-lead guitarist of a music band, and makes his living through the stage and street performances. As narrated in the diary, Komali comes from an orthodox Telugu Brahmin family. She is interested in classical music and ends up learning the violin at a musical school in Barcelona under fiddle professor, Brahma. In a twist of fate, she falls in love with Sanju and gets approval for their inter-caste marriage, from their parents in India. Komali unknowingly gets caught after video footage that she accidentally shot while Shawar Ali kills the Spanish ambassador, in the process of money laundering. 
Sanju saves Komali from these henchmen, on a couple of occasions; this is where the story in the diary ends abruptly. Out of curiosity, Akanksha starts questioning Sanju about their love story and, in the process, ends up with disturbing facts. On continuous asking by Akanksha, Sanju tells her that Komali is dead. It is then shown in a flashback that for fixing the marriage of Sanju and Komali, their parents had come to Spain. It was at that time that Komali is kidnapped by Shawar Ali's brother, and when Sanju comes to save her, Komali is murdered by Shawar Ali's brother. In a fit of rage, Sanju bashes up the whole gang, and Shawar Ali's brother goes into a coma. 
On hearing this, Akanksha feels sorry for Sanju and falls in love with him. She also tries to bring him out of the memory of Komali but in vain. Meanwhile, Akanksha spots Komali crossing a street. Akanksha runs to Sanju to tell him about Komali, and at that time, Sanju gets surrounded by Shawar Ali's men. Sanju, while bashing up Shawar Ali's men, tells Akanksha that it was his plan to trap her in his love to avenge the death of his and Komali's parents at the hands of Shawar Ali. It is then shown in a flashback that after beating up Shawar's brother, Sanju had taken Komali's body to the hospital, from where Sanju's father calls up the Central Minister to arrest Shawar Ali in Spain after watching the video footage. 
The Central minister then calls up Shawar Ali to finish off this trouble in order to save himself. Shawar Ali then goes to the hospital and kills Sanju's and Komali's parents and shoots Sanju and Komali, and they are presumed dead. However, Sanju and Komali didn't die. It is then revealed that Sanju has been waiting all this time to get his revenge and has made Akanksha the pawn in this game, and it was he who faxed their photo in order to make Shawar Ali jealous so that Shawar Ali will come himself to kill Sanju. Later, it is revealed that Komali is not dead and that they both wanted to avenge their parents' death. Sanju and Shawar engage in a battle in the forest where Sanju kills Shawar Ali with Akanksha's help. Sanju and Komali live happily, while Akanksha lives alone.

"It's a stylish film though emotions didn't work."[16] Mahesh S Koneru of 123telugu.com gave a review stating "'Iddarammayilatho' is a very stylish offering from Puri Jagan.

The slow pace in the second half and the absence of traditional Puri Jagan elements like heroism and punch dialogues might hamper the overall experience."[17] Girija Narayan of Oneindia Entertainment gave a review stating "Iddarammayilatho is definitely a good movie to watch.

The climax definitely lets the viewers go home happy."[18] Sasidhar AS of The Times of India gave a review stating, "Iddarammayilatho hits you like fresh air, and you instantly fall for the lead characters, refreshingly flesh-and-blood with their set of quirks, flaws and strengths.
