Oreochromis chungruruensis, the Kiungululu tilapia, is a species of cichlid fish that is endemic to Lake Chungruru (also known as Kiungululu), a small isolated crater lake in the Rungwe District in southern Tanzania.[1] This species reaches up to 15.4 cm (6.1 in) in standard length and 19.5 cm (7.7 in) in total length.[2] It is critically endangered due to overfishing and non-native tilapia species that have been introduced to Lake Chungruru.[1]
