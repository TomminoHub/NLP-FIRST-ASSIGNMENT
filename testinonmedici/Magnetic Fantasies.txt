Bruce F. Webster reviewed Magnetic Fantasies in The Space Gamer No. 43.[2] Webster commented that "Recommendation: look before you buy, and buy only if there is some information in there worth the cost of the magazine.  I realize they're just starting ... but I don't remember the early Space Gamers being this bad."[2]
