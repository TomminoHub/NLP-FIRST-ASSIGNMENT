The gray-headed lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps), or gray-headed brown lemur, is a medium-sized primate, a cathemeral species of lemur in the family Lemuridae. Until a taxonomic revision in 2008, it was known as the white-collared brown lemur or white-collared lemur (Eulemur albocollaris).[4] It lives in south-eastern Madagascar.[1] In 2005, satellite imagery estimates showed approximately 700 km2 (270 sq mi) of total remaining habitat within its geographic range.[5] It is highly threatened by hunting and habitat loss, and was considered to be among the 25 most endangered primates in 2006–2008.[6] It is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to a highly restricted range,[1] and has been named one of "The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates."[7]
The gray-headed lemur is only found in southeastern Madagascar, from the Manampatrana River south to the Mananara River.[5][8]
Recent genetic and morphological evidence has suggested that the former name, E. albocollaris, was actually a junior synonym of E. cinereiceps.[1] Consequently, the common name gray-headed lemur and the scientific name Eulemur cinereiceps were resurrected to replace white-collared brown lemur and E. albocollaris respectively.[4][9]
Previously, this species was listed as a subspecies of the common brown lemur until elevated to species status in 2001. However, genetic and field studies still support subspecies status under the biological species concept.[5]
