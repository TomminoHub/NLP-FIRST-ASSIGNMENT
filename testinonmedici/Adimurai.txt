Adimurai is an Indian martial art originating in modern-day Kanyakumari, the southernmost region in India. It was traditionally practiced in the Kanyakumari district of modern-day Tamil Nadu as well as nearby areas in southeastern Kerala. Its preliminary empty-hand techniques are called Adithada and application of vital points are called Varma Adi, although these terms are sometimes interchangeably used to refer to the martial art itself.[1] Adimurai is a portmanteau in the Tamil language where adi means "to hit or strike" and murai means method or procedure. In modern period it is used alongside other Tamil martial arts.[2]
Adithadi is a non-lethal version of Adimurai which was developed in the Tamilnadu region of ancient India. It saw most of its practice in the Chola and Pandya kingdoms, where preliminary empty hand techniques were used.[3]
Adimurai is traditionally practiced outdoors or in unroofed areas. It is mainly practiced by, Kallars, and Nadars of southern Tamil Nadu.[4] Techniques include strictly punching, basic kicking and basic blocking. 
Adimurai was depicted in the film Pattas (2020) starring Dhanush, directed by R. S. Durai Senthilkumar.[5][6]
Adhiveeran (Udhayanidhi Stalin), the secondary protagonist in the film Maamannan (2023), is an Adimurai tutor.[7]
