The Ragusano is a breed of donkey from the Mediterranean island of Sicily.[2] It is associated particularly with the comuni of Modica, Ragusa, Santa Croce Camerina and Scicli, all in the Province of Ragusa in southern Sicily.[3] It is one of the eight autochthonous donkey breeds of limited distribution recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.[4] The Ragusano was listed as "endangered" by the FAO in 2007.[1]
The milk of the Ragusano donkey has demonstrated remarkable antiviral properties and some scientists believe it could be useful in preventing viral human gastrointestinal infections.[5]
