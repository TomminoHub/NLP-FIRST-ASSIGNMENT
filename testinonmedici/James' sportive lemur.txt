James' sportive lemur (Lepilemur jamesorum), or the Manombo sportive lemur, is a sportive lemur endemic to Madagascar.  It is one of the larger sportive lemurs with a total length of about 60 to 67 cm (24 to 26 in), of which 28 to 32 cm (11 to 13 in) are tail.[4]  James' sportive lemur is found in southeastern Madagascar, living in primary and secondary lowland forests.[4]
Originally named L. jamesi, the name was found to be incorrectly formed and was corrected to L. jamesorum in 2009.[5]
