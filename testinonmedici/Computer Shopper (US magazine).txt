Computer Shopper was a monthly consumer computer magazine published by SX2 Media Labs. The magazine ceased print publication in April 2009.[1][2] The website was closed and redirected to the PCMag website in late May 2018.[3][4]
Computer Shopper magazine was established in 1979 in Titusville, Florida.[5] It began as a tabloid-size publication on yellow newsprint that primarily contained classified advertising and ads for kit computers, parts, and software. The magazine was created by Glenn Patch, publisher of the photo-equipment magazine Shutterbug Ads, in the hopes of applying its formula to a PC-technology magazine.[6]  The magazine expanded into prebuilt home computers and white box IBM PC compatibles through the 1980s.[7]
The magazine grew to several hundred pages, mostly of advertisements.[7] It was during this time that the magazine was sold to Ziff Davis Publishing, first as a limited partnership,[8] then solely owned. It was sold in 2000, along with Ziff-Davis' ZDNet Web site, to CNET. CNET sold Computer Shopper to new owners, SX2 Media Labs, in 2006.[9] In April 2009, SX2 Media Labs discontinued the print version of the magazine.[10] The business continued on as a Web entity, ComputerShopper.com, which was reacquired by Ziff-Davis in 2012.[9]
