Donkey Hodie is an American puppet live action musical preschool television series created by David and Adam Rudman for PBS Kids, and is aimed at preschoolers ages 3 to 5. Inspired by characters created by Fred Rogers, the series premiered May 3, 2021[1] and is the second spinoff of Rogers' television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood after Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood.[2] The first full episode was initially set to premiere in winter 2021 on PBS Kids in the United States, but it was pushed back to May 3 of the same year. Sometimes, television airings are followed up by a series of shorts; "Through the Woods", "What Can You Become?", and "Elinor Wonders Why: That's So Interesting!".
On April 7, 2022, it was announced that Donkey Hodie was renewed for a second season which was slated to premiere in spring 2023 but was delayed to August 14, 2023.[3][4]
In the land of Someplace Else, just north of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, Donkey Hodie and her friends go throughout their day while solving different problems along the way.
The characters of Duck Duck, Clyde the Cloud, Game Show Gator, Stanley the Dragon, Super Porcupine and Dodie Hodie are new characters created for the Donkey Hodie series.[5]
The series was announced in January 2020. The title character is the granddaughter of the original Donkey Hodie, a character from the Neighborhood of Make Believe on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.[5][6][7][8]
Like Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, the series includes both new songs as well as songs written by Rogers.
The music for the show was composed by Bill Sherman, Zack Zeyde, and Noah Deblasis.
