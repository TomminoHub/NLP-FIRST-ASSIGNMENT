Brookesia tristis is a species of chameleons. It is endemic to Montagne des Français, Madagascar, and is an endangered species due to the decline of its habitat.[1] It was named after the French word "triste" meaning sad to provoke thought regarding the threatened habitat of Madagascar's micro-endemic species. B. Triste was first found in an isolated patch of forest near an expanding city in 2012 by a research team led by Dr. Frank Glaw from the Zoologische Staatssammlung München.[2]
