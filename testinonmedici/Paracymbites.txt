Animals belonging to this genus had small shells with semicircular whorl section and rounded or fastigate venter, of which umbilicus made about 25% of diameter. Last whorl could have been excentric. Keel was faint and it might have been only on the earlier part of the last whorl. Aperture had ventral rostrum. Body chamber made about 75% of whorl and was faintly plicate, or smooth.[1]
