Baharijodon is an extinct genus of trematochampsid crocodylomorph.[1] It is known from the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, which dates back to the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The genus is known from a single tooth, which was first figured by Ernst Stromer in 1933, and then named as a new genus of the family Goniopholididae by Oskar Kuhn in 1936. In 1979, Ã‰ric Buffetaut and P. Taquet instead referred the tooth to Trematochampsidae.[2]
