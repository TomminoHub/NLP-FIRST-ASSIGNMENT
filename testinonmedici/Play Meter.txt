Play Meter (initially Coin Industry Play Meter) was an American trade magazine focusing on the coin-op amusement arcade industry, including jukebox and arcade game machines. It was founded in December 1974 by publisher and editor Ralph C. Lally II and it is published in physical form by Skybird Publishing on a monthly basis. Together with rival publication RePlay (founded 1975) it chronicled the arcade industry from its nascency, through market fluctuations like the video game crashes of 1977 and 1983, and the rebirth and maturation of the medium through the 1980s.[2] It is the earliest example of video game journalism,[3][4][5] establishing such practices as individual video game reviews[6][7] and the ten-point assessment scale for video game reviews.[8]
Play Meter served as the parent organization of the first coin-op-oriented spring trade show (forerunner to North America's annual Amusement Expo). It published several bi-monthly and annual special issues throughout its history and it maintains a website where online content is also published monthly.
The magazine shut down after publishing the June 2018 issue, coinciding with publisher Carol Lally's retirement.[9]
Play Meter released a number of special issues.[19]
