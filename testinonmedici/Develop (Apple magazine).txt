develop, The Apple Technical Journal, was a hard-copy magazine published by Apple containing detailed technical and programming articles written primarily by Apple engineers.[1] Twenty-nine quarterly issues were published between January 1990 and March 1997. The headquarters was in Cupertino, CA.[1] With Apple's purchase of NeXT and the subsequent closing of numerous divisions within Apple, develop was closed and turned into a guest column within MacTech which continues to this day.
