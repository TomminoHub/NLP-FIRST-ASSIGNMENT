Archive is a membership magazine for users of the Acorn Archimedes personal computer and related RISC OS hardware. It is the oldest and longest-running RISC OS magazine.[citation needed]
The first issue was announced in September 1987[1][2] and came out in October 1987, a month before the launch of RISC User.[3] In August 2007, Jim Nagel took over from the founding editor Paul Beverley. After the death of Jim Nagel on 21 March 2020, the editorship passed to Gavin Smith.[4] Members of The ARM Club were offered discounted subscriptions in 1999, around the time of the discontinuation of Archimedes World and announced closure of RISC User.[5]
