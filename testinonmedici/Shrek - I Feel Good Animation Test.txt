Shrek - I Feel Good Animation Test is a 1996 American short lost film that was directed by Jeffrey Katzenberg and produced by J.J Abrams, Rob Letterman, and Loren Soman. The animation test of Shrek is set to James Brown's 1965 single, "I Got You (I Feel Good)".[1][2]
An 11-second clip of the film was uploaded to YouTube on August 15, 2022.[2] On September 15, 2023, a YouTube user named TheNormalGuy213 found more stills from the film.
The film has been a popular source of discussion in the animation community, and the Lost Media community, due to the mystery and the few seconds of the film existing. This film is technically found, with only 11 seconds of the film existing on YouTube, and several stills from the movie, with the rest being held by an unknown eBay buyer who bought the film and several sculptures of the old Shrek model on a now closed eBay auction, that was opened by a Dreamworks employee named Tim Lawrence II. The eBay buyer has not released the film to the internet, and it is unknown why this buyer hasn't released the film.
Shrek is dancing around in the streets, damcing to the 1965 James Brown single, "I Got You (I Feel Good)" After dancing for 30 seconds, a masked bandit jumps from a building to rob a bank but falls onto Shrek. The bandit threatens Shrek with a knife, but Shrek laughs at him, and he pulls the rope on the bandit that he used to jump onto Shrek, and he the bandit is sent flying into the sky. Shrek looks up, and then begins dancing back to the song "I Feel Good."
When it was presented to Jeffrey Katzenberg and other officials in May of 1997, Katzenberg disliked it to the point that he discarded the tape that the animation team held during that meeting, (they had another tape which was sold in the eBay auction in 2018) and the animation team who worked on the film, named the Propellerheads, were consequently fired after the presentation.
