Mega Power was launched following the success of Paragon Publishing's first publication, Sega Pro.  Dave Perry along with a small editorial team helped the magazine become the first console publication to include a cover CD.[citation needed] The magazine was in circulation between August 1993 and July 1995.[1]
Issue 4, November 1993, included the first ever cover mounted demo playable on a Sega console, that being Thunderhawk.[2]  Game demo insert covers were provided, through the magazine, to use with the CD and an empty case.
Various other game demo CDs were released through 1993 and 1994 and they became a regular feature after May 1994.  Other playable game demos CDs have included:-
Soulstar
Battlecorps
