PlayStation Underground is a now-defunct American video game magazine, originally published by Sony Computer Entertainment America. The magazine focused on the PlayStation fanbase, including gaming on the original Sony PlayStation and the PlayStation 2, and was promoted as a "PlayStation fan club".[1] Unlike its paper-based counterpart the Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, PlayStation Underground came in the form of CD-ROMs which could be played on the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles. Subscribers were also given access to a members-only website.[2] The magazine released its first issue on March 26, 1997[3] and its final issue in 2001. The magazine released a total of seventeen issues during its active years.[4] The magazine was eventually merged with Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine in 2001 when it was discontinued.
In 2015, PlayStation Underground returned as a video series where gameplay from upcoming games is shown in a Let's Play format while the PlayStation.Blog team discusses the game with the developer.[5]
Each issue consists of two CD-ROMs that can be played on a PlayStation or a PlayStation 2 console, or an emulator.[3]
The second disc contains mostly demos of upcoming games as well as game trailers. For example, in the second issue of PlayStation Underground the second disc was a Square themed disc containing demos to Final Fantasy VII and Bushido Blade as well as exclusive upcoming trailers of new Square games.[4]
PlayStation Underground featured video interviews with many high-profile game designers as well as other notable figures in the entertainment industry internationally during their Debriefing, Tech Q&A and Behind The Scenes segments, these include:
The RP-T version of PlayStation Underground's 'Holiday 2004' demo disc was released with a major glitch that caused the save data to be wiped on all memory cards connected to the PlayStation 2 if the demo for Viewtiful Joe 2 was played.[6][7][8] Sony sent an email to subscribers of the magazine warning users to remove the memory cards from the PlayStation 2 before inserting the demo disc.[6]
