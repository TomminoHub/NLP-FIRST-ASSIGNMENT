PPC Journal was an early hobbyist computer magazine, originally targeted at users of HP's first programmable calculator, the HP-65. It originated as 65 Notes and the first issue was published in 1974.[1] It later changed names in 1978 to PPC Journal and in 1980 to PPC Calculator Journal.[1] With Volume 12 published in 1984 the magazine was renamed PPC Journal.[1] The magazine ended publication in July 1987 (Volume 14).[1]
The founder of the PPC (Personal Programming Center) and editor of the journal was Richard J. Nelson.[2] This hobbyist group worked around the journal and was known because Nelson discovered hidden instructions on the HP-65 calculator. Later the club and the journal got maximum notoriety when several club members discovered the "synthetic instructions" of the HP-41C.
A similar journal since 1976 was 52-Notes for the Texas Instruments SR-52 user community.[3] It was edited by Richard C. Vanderburgh.[3] Both journals deliberately established a mode of "friendly competition", often exchanging information and comparing solutions among user groups.[3] This journal was later renamed into TI PPC Notes and edited by Maurice E. T. Swinnen (from January 1980 to December 1982) and Palmer O. Hanson, Jr. (from January 1983).
