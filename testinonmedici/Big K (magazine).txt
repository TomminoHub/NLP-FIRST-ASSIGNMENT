Big K was a short-lived multi format magazine published by IPC Magazines Ltd during the 1980s.  The design of the magazine was very similar in style to their comic strip publications at the time, 2000ad and Roy of the Rovers and seemed to be aimed squarely at the younger computer user despite the type-in software listings for which the reader needed a real (8bit) computer. Listings where provided for VIC, ORIC, DRAGON, COMMODORE, ZX81, ZX SPECTRUM Big K typeins for ZX Spectrum, BBC
The March 1985 issue featured the first episode of the digitally created comic strip Shatter, although as this was the last Big K printed, it was also Shatter's only appearance until a run in Jon Sable: Freelance from issues #25-30 in June 1985.
