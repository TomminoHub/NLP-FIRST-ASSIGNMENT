Computer Weekly is a digital magazine and website for IT professionals in the United Kingdom. It was formerly published as a weekly print magazine by Reed Business Information for over 50 years. Topics covered within the magazine include outsourcing, security, data centres, information management, cloud computing, and mobile computing to computer hacking and strategy for IT management.
The magazine was available free to IT professionals who met the circulation requirements. A small minority of issues were sold in retail outlets, with the bulk of revenue received from display and recruitment advertising. The magazine is still available free as a PDF digital edition. Computer Weekly was available in print and digital format and the readership was audited by BPA Worldwide, which verified its circulation twice yearly.  The circulation figure was 135,035 according to the publisher's statement in August 2007.
Bryan Glick is the editor-in-chief of Computer Weekly, having joined in November 2009.[1]
Computer Weekly won the UK Periodical Publishers Association (PPA) "Campaign of the Year" Award five times in seven years as it was involved in IT-related campaigns such as the costs of the NHS computer system, websites for disabled people and the Chinook crash on Mull of Kintyre.
The magazine was transferred to a digital edition in May 2011 after [2] TechTarget bought the Computer Weekly website and events.[3] On September 22, 2016, the magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary. At the time, its circulation figure was 200,000 magazines per week, and 400,000 magazines once monthly and quarterly regional editions were counted.[4]
