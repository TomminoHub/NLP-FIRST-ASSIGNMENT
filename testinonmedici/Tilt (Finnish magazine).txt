Tilt was a Finnish video games magazine published 10 times a year by Yhtyneet kuvalehdet OY. In the Finnish gaming magazine scene Tilt was a newcomer, challenging mainly the well-established Pelit magazine with another newcomer, Pelaaja. Tilt covered both PC and consoles.
Tilt leveraged the brand of similarly named Finnish TV show hosted by Anna-Maija Jalkanen, although the magazine was targeted for a more mature audience.
Tilt magazine lasted in the market for about a year. The publishing company pulled the plug and the magazine was quietly discontinued.
