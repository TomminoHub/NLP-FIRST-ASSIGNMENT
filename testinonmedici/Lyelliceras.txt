Lyelliceras is a genus of ammonites belonging to the family Lyelliceratidae. These cephalopods were fast-moving nektonic carnivores. They lived in the Cretaceous period, Albian stage (109.0 to 99.7 Ma).[1][2]
The genus has been named after geologist Charles Lyell.
Shells of Lyelliceras species can reach a diameter of about 50 millimetres (2.0 in). They are moderately to very evolute. The section of the whorls is slightly compressed or circular, with straight radial ribs.[3][4]
The following species have been recognised:[1]
Fossils of species within this genus have been found in the Cretaceous sediments of Colombia (Hiló Formation, Tolima), France, Madagascar, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States and Venezuela.[1]
