PC Accelerator (PCXL) was an American personal computer game magazine that was published by Imagine Media (currently a subsidiary of Future plc). It was known for its Maxim-like humor and photography.
PC Accelerator was started by Imagine Media in 1998.[1] The first issue was published in September 1998.[2] The magazine was published on a monthly basis.[1] Its last issue was dated June 2000.[3]
After the split up of the magazine, editor-in-chief Mike Salmon went on to start the Official Xbox Magazine.[4] While some of the staff was sent to PC Gamer, others went on to work for Daily Radar. In September 2007, a special Fall issue of PCXL was released to newsstands only. This issue was primarily written by the current staff of PC Gamer with contributions by former PCXL staff including Rob Smith and Dan Egger.[5]
Games were reviewed on a scale of 0-10. Half-Life was the only game to receive an 11 (in the February 1999 issue).
There were more editors and artists that followed.
There was a game reviewed in the magazine that never existed... and was completely fabricated including screenshots, developer interviews, company website and a developer company front.[citation needed]
Every night, the staffs of PC Gamer and PCXL would challenge each other to massive team on team Rainbow Six battles.[6]
