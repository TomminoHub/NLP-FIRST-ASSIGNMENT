Videogaming Illustrated, also known as VGI,[1] was a video game magazine published in the United States and ran from August 1982 to March 1984.
VGI changed its title twice: in issue June 1983 to Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated and in issue January 1984 to Video and Computer Gaming Illustrated.
It began life as a bi-monthly publication before becoming a monthly publication.[1] Its short run has been explained by the video game crash of 1983.[2][3][4]
The magazine was split up into the following sections:
The Star Words section featured commentary about computer games from celebrities such as Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas.[5]
