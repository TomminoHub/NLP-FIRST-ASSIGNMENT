Commodore Disk User, also referred to as CDU, was a magazine for the Commodore range of computers, including the Commodore 64, Commodore 128 and Commodore Plus/4. Each issue had a cover-mounted disk containing software.
It was published in the UK by Argus Specialist Publications[2] which also published the Your Commodore. It was aimed at Commodore users who had a 1541 disk drive and did not want to have to type in program listings.[3] It also meant that larger programs could be included with the magazine. Initially, an issue of the magazine was published every two months but after two years, it became monthly.[3]
The magazine survived until the end of 1991. The last issue (number 36) was cover dated October 1991.[3] Copies were scanned into Archive.org in 2011.[3]
