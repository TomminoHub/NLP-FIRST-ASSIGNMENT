When a smuggler kills his sister, Bharani, a meek man vows to deliver justice for her death and joins a martial arts school. He trains hard there to become a master fighter, honing his fighting skills. Taking on a new identity, Paayum Puli (Pouncing Tiger), he sets off for revenge, but the affection of a beautiful woman Revathy soon puts a hitch in his plans.
Cashing on the then huge popularity of Bruce Lee and his martial arts films, S. P. Muthuraman and Panchu Arunachalam designed the story of Paayum Puli. Judo. K. K. Rathnam was the action choreographer,[3] and the film was inspired by The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978).[4] The production company AVM Productions initially wanted A. C. Tirulokchandar to play the antagonist, but he declined.[5] Karate Mani, a stuntman was later cast in the role, but he walked out. The role finally went to Jaishankar.[6][7]
The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja and lyrics were written by Vaali.[8][9] The disco song "Aadi Maasam" was well received, and it was later remixed by Srikanth Deva in Thottupaar (2010).[10]
Paayum Puli was released on 14 January 1983, Pongal day.[11][12] Thiraignani of Kalki said the real pouncing tigers of the film were the hero and the technicians.[13] The film was a commercial success, completed a 133-day run at theatres,[14] and grossed over ₹20 million (equivalent to ₹340 million or US$4.2 million in 2023).[15] The makers wanted to release the film in Sri Lanka, but got into trouble as the title had "puli" (tiger), perceived as alluding to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. It was decided to release the film in the country with the title Irumbu Karangal (transl. Iron hands), but the film still did not release there.[16]
