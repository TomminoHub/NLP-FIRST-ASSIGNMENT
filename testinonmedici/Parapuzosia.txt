Parapuzosia is an extinct genus of desmoceratid ammonites from the Cenomanian to the Campanian of Africa, Europe, and North America.[2] They are typically very large ammonites, reaching diameters of 60 cm (2.0 ft) or more, with the largest species measuring around 2 m (6.6 ft).[3] It possesses a moderately involute shell with flat or slightly rounded sides. Distinct primary and secondary ribbing can be observed in the inner whorls.[4]
The origin of the generic name Parapuzosia ("similar to Puzosia") comes from the smaller, related desmatoceratid Puzosia. "Puzosia" comes from the Serbian words "пужа/Puzo" (Snail) and "Oca/Osia" (Axis), translating to "snail axis".[citation needed]
