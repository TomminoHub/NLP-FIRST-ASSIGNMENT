The compressed cover tree is a type of data structure in computer science that is specifically designed to facilitate the speed-up of a k-nearest neighbors algorithm in finite metric spaces.[1] Compressed cover tree is a simplified version of explicit representation of cover tree that was motivated by past issues in proofs of time complexity results[2] of cover tree.
The compressed cover tree was specifically designed to achieve claimed time complexities of cover tree[3] in a mathematically rigorous way. 
In the modern formulation, the k-nearest neighbor problem is to find all 



k
≥
1


{\displaystyle k\geq 1}

 nearest neighbors in a given reference set R for all points from another given query set Q. Both sets belong to a common ambient space X with a distance metric d satisfying all metric axioms.
Let (R,d) be a finite metric space. A compressed cover tree 





T

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}(R)}

 has the vertex set R with a root 



r

{\displaystyle r\in R}

 and a level function

{\displaystyle l:R\rightarrow \mathbb {Z} }

In a metric space, let

{\displaystyle {\bar {B}}(p,t)}

{\displaystyle |{\bar {B}}(p,t)|}

Although cover trees provide faster searches than the naive approach, this advantage must be weighed with the additional cost of maintaining the data structure. In a naive approach adding a new point to the dataset is trivial because order does not need to be preserved, but in a compressed cover tree it can be bounded 
Let Q and R be finite subsets of a metric space (X,d). Once all points of R are inserted into a compressed cover tree

 it can be used for find-queries of the query point set Q.
The following time complexities have been proven for finding the k-nearest neighbor of a query point

The compressed cover tree constructed on finite metric space R requires O(|R|) space, during the construction and during the execution of the Find algorithm.
