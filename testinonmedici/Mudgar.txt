A mudgar (Sanskrit: मुद्गर, romanized: mudgara) or mudgara[3] is a type of gada (mace) from India, and it is generally considered to be made of wood, but can also be made of iron.[4]
The mudgar appears is ancient Indian sculptures, where it is commonly held by Yaksha deities, known as mudgarpani (mudgarapāṇi; mudgar-holders).[5]
An ancient Jain story named the Antagadadasao tell the story of a man named Ajjunaka who was worshipping the image of the "Yaksa who held a mace", when he was attacked by five bandits, an event which shaked is devotion to the Yashka. Afterwards the Yaksa possessed Ajjunaka, giving him the strength to kill the five bandits.[6]
Nowadays, for training purposes when using Indian clubs, one or two wooden gada ("mudgar"), reaching up to 70 kilograms in weight, can be used: they can be swung behind the back in several different ways; this is particularly useful for building grip strength and shoulder endurance.[7][8]
