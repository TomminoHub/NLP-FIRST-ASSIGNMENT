Terebratula is a modern genus of brachiopods with a fossil record dating back to the Late Devonian. These brachiopods are stationary epifaunal suspension feeders and have a worldwide distribution.
Terebratula species have biconvex egg-shaped shells, anterior margins of the valves have two small folds, concentric growth lines are quite thin or nearly absent. The larger valve has a ventral umbo with the opening through which they extend a short peduncle.[1]
As Terebratula has been erected early on in paleontology, many species have since been reassigned to other genera.[2]
