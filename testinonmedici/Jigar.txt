Jigar is a 1992 Indian Hindi-language martial arts film directed by Farogh Siddique. It was released during the Diwali weekend and proved to be a successful hit.[1] The plot is inspired by the 1989 American film Kickboxer.[2]
Raju and Duryodhan are very good friends. Suman is Raju's love interest and is like a sister to Duryodhan. Duryodhan is a wrestler and works at a martial arts training school owned by Lal Bihari. Due to some misunderstanding between Raju, Duryodhan and Raju's sister, she is raped by Duryodhan. This angers Raju, but he fails in avenging his sister because Duryodhan is a wrestler. Raju starts training as a fighter under Baba Thakur. After being fully trained, he avenges all of his enemies. Duryodhan is killed in the ring itself, and Lal Bihari is killed by Suman.
