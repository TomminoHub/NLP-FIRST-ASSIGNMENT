Pagadai Panirendu (transl.â€‰Twelve dices) is a 1982 Indian Tamil-language martial arts film directed by Dhamodharan N., starring Kamal Haasan, Sripriya and Y. G. Mahendran. Kanchana plays a guest role.[1] The film was released on 14 November 1982.[2]
The film is the story of Anand, a journalist and a martial arts expert. Anand is in love with Sripriya. He gets a microfilm showing the wrongdoings of underworld king Sudarsan. Now the gang is after Anand for the microfilm. Sudarsan's gang member Sathyapriya befriends Anand to get the microfilm, but fails. Meanwhile, Anand's love Sripriya leaves her house as her father, and Major Sundarrajan is against their affair. Sripriya gets threatened by Sudarsan's gang for the microfilm. Anand's friend Y. G. Mahendran also gets trapped by the underworld gang to retrieve the microfilm. Anand had to fight against his martial arts master too, who is an aide of Sudarsan. Finally, Anand succeeds in eliminating the entire gang, saving the microfilm. When viewing the film one is given the impression that it had significant delays in production. Having been started as early as 1978 after the success of two back-to back Kamal Haasan/Sri Priya starrers namely Ilamai Oonjaladugiradhu & Sattam En Kayil the film saw the light of the day finally in 1982.
The music was composed by K. Chakravarthy and lyrics were written by Kannadasan and Vaali.[6]
Thiraignani of Kalki felt Kamal Haasan was only wasting time fighting kung-fu throughout the film but praised the acting of Sripriya but felt other actors were wasted. He however praised Lakshman Gore's cinematography and Kiruba Shankar's stunt choreography and concluded this film is okay for those who love Kamal and action.[7]
