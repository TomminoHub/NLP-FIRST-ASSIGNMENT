IT Examiner was an information technology news website based in Bangalore, India.[1]
The publication was established in 2008 by journalist Mike Magee, who had previously established The Register and The Inquirer. It was financially backed by Chinese company Metaplume, with the aim of capitalising on the growth of India's burgeoning IT industry.[1]
In 2009, Metaplume terminated all the staff and the site was shut down.[2]
