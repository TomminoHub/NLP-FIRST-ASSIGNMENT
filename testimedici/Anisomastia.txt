Anisomastia is a medical condition in which there is a severe asymmetry or unequalness in the size of the breasts, generally related to a difference in volume.[1] In other words, when one of the breasts is much larger than the other.[2] In contrast to anisomastia, a slight  asymmetry of the breasts is common.[1] Anisomastia may be corrected by surgical breast augmentation or reduction.[3]
