In psychiatry, catastrophic schizophrenia or schizocaria is an obsolete[1] term for a rare[2][3] and acute form of schizophrenia leading directly to a severe and unremitting chronic psychosis[4] (the long term occurrence of psychosis) and deterioration of the personality.[2] Catastrophic schizophrenia was thought to be the most severe subtype of schizophrenia, as it had "an acute onset and rapid decline into a chronic state without remission".[5]  Catastrophic schizophrenia was also referred to as schizocaria, which was defined by Gerhard Mauz as a psychosis that caused the absolute destruction of the core of one's being.[6]
The term "catastrophic schizophrenia" has fallen out of use due to a number of reasons, including advances in psychiatric treatment, which led to a significant decline in patients that fit the diagnosis as their symptoms did not reach the severity of catastrophic schizophrenia, along with modern refinement of the definition and subtypes of schizophrenia.[7]  This term has not been included in any version of the DSM.  In modern terms, catastrophic schizophrenia would likely be defined as 'acute-onset chronic schizophrenia with poor prognosis'.
Schizophrenia evolved from Kraepelin's dementia praecox, which was first defined in 1893. Using dementia praecox as a base, Eugen Bleuler defined and differentiated subtypes of schizophrenia at the turn of the century.  He stated that catastrophic schizophrenia was characterized by an acute onset of a severe psychosis, followed with little improvement by a severe chronic psychosis lasting until death.[8]
Young adults (aged 16–25) were at the highest risk of developing catastrophic schizophrenia.  It was almost entirely exclusive to upper class and intellectuals.[6] Other risk factors included difficulty adapting to change, individualism, and introversion.[6]
E.B. Strauss stated that schizophrenia could come about in two ways: either catastrophically or through a series of 'attacks'.[6]  Strauss used catastrophic to refer to schizophrenia that ran a rapidly progressing and continuous course.[6]  According to Strauss, catastrophic schizophrenia took a similar course to catatonic schizophrenia and hebephrenia, with all three ending in the total collapse into psychosis within two to four years.[6]
Eugen Bleuler found that catastrophic schizophrenia affected 10-15% of people with schizophrenia.[7] However, over time, the number of patients that fit this diagnosis declined significantly.  The outcome of a study by Luc Ciompi and Christian Müller in 1976 has shown that only 6 percent of patients with schizophrenia were judged to have catastrophic schizophrenia.[4][9][10]
In longitudinal studies begun in the 1930s and ending in the 1980s, Manfred Bleuler (Eugen's son) found the incidences[spelling?] of catastrophic schizophrenia had declined significantly since his father's study.[11] Manfred Bleuler posited that improved hospitals, nursing care, and rehabilitation efforts led to this decline.[7]  The decline of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), chlorpromazine, and insulin shock therapy, used extensively in the 1940s and 1950s, could have also played a role in eliminating catastrophic schizophrenia.[7]  The term was not included in the DSM-I and is now no longer used, due to changes in how the sub-types of schizophrenia are defined.
