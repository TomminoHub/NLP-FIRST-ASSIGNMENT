Conservative management is a type of medical treatment defined by the avoidance of invasive measures such as surgery or other invasive procedures,[1]  usually with the intent to preserve function or body parts.[2] For example, in appendicitis, conservative management may include watchful waiting and treatment with antibiotics, as opposed to surgical removal of the appendix.[3]
