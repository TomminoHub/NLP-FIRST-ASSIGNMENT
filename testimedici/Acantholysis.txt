Acantholysis is the loss of intercellular connections, such as desmosomes, resulting in loss of cohesion between keratinocytes,[1] seen in diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris.[2] It is absent in bullous pemphigoid, making it useful for differential diagnosis.
This histological feature is also seen in herpes simplex infections (HSV 1 and 2) and varicella zoster infections (chicken pox and shingles).
