Cervical conization refers to an excision of a cone-shaped portion of tissue from the mucous membrane of the cervix. Conization is used for diagnostic purposes as part of a biopsy and for therapeutic purposes to remove pre-cancerous cells (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) or early stage cervical cancer.[1]
Types include:[2][3]
Cervical conization effectively reduces the risk of cancer developing or spreading but it causes an increased risk of premature birth in future pregnancies.[2][3]
The chances of cancer recurrence and premature birth depends on the type of conization. Cold knife conization is associated with 7% chance of the cancer recurring and 16% chance of premature birth, laser conisation comes with 6% cancer recurrence and 13% premature birth, and loop excision comes with 10% recurrence and 11% premature birth.[2][3]
