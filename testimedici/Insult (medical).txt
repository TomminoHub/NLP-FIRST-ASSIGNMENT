In medical terms, an insult is the cause of some kind of physical or mental injury.  For example, a burn on the skin (the injury) may be the result of a thermal, chemical, radioactive, or electrical event (the insult).[1]  Likewise sepsis and trauma are examples of foreign insults,[2] and encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors are examples of insults to the brain.[3]
Clinicians may use the term cerebrovascular insult (CVI) as a synonym for a stroke.[4][5]
Insults may be categorized as either genetic or environmental.[6]
