Hyperkatifeia is defined as hypersensitivity to emotional distress in the context of opioid abuse.[1]
Hyperkatifeia and Opioid-induced hyperalgesia can be seen with long-term use of illicit street opioids e.g. heroin, and prescription opioids e.g. hydrocodone and oxycodone during withdrawal.[citation needed]
