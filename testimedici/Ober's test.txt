Ober's test is used in physical examination to identify tightness of the iliotibial band (iliotibial band syndrome).
During the test, the patient lies on his/her side with the unaffected leg on the bottom with their shoulder and pelvis in line. The lower hip and knee can be in a flexed position to take out any lordosis of the lumbar spine.[1]
No studies support the validity of the Ober test for measuring iliotibial band tightness.[2]
