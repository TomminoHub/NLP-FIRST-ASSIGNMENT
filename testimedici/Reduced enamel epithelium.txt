The reduced enamel epithelium, sometimes called reduced dental epithelium, overlies a developing tooth and is formed by two layers: a layer of ameloblast cells and the adjacent layer of cuboidal cells (outer enamel epithelium) from the dental lamina.

The degeneration of reduced enamel epithelium also mediates the initial epithelial attachment to the tooth, which is called the junctional epithelium.
The reduced enamel epithelium consist of:
