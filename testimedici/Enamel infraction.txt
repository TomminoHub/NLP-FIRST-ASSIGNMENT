Enamel infractions are microcracks seen within the dental enamel of a tooth.[1] They are commonly the result of dental trauma to the brittle enamel, which remains adherent to the underlying dentine. They can be seen more clearly when transillumination is used.[2]
Enamel infractions are found more often in older teeth, as the accumulated trauma is greatest.[3] Enamel infractions can also be found as a result of iatrogenic damage inadvertently caused by instrumentation during dental treatments.[4]
Minor infraction may not require any treatment, however major infraction may require treatment including smoothing, fluoride treatment and crown restoration.[5]
