The Terminologia Histologica (TH) is the controlled vocabulary for use in cytology and histology.[1][2] In April 2011, Terminologia Histologica was published online[3] by the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminologies (FIPAT), the successor of FCAT.
It was intended to replace Nomina Histologica. The Nomina Histologica was introduced in 1977, with the fourth edition of Nomina Anatomica.[4]
It was developed by the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology.
