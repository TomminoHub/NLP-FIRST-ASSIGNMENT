Pyonephrosis (Greek pyon "pus" + nephros "kidney") is an infection of the kidneys' collecting system. Pus collects in the renal pelvis and causes distension of the kidney. It can cause kidney failure.[1]
Pyonephrosis is sometimes a complication of kidney stones, which can be a source of persisting infection. It may also occur spontaneously. It can occur as a complication of hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis.[citation needed]
CECT is investigation of choice.
This requires drainage, best performed by ureteral stent placement or nephrostomy.[citation needed]
Surgery - Nephrectomy, if the ureter affects - Nephroureterectomy.
If the second kidney is not healthy, only drainage of the kidney or puncture nephrostomy is performed.
