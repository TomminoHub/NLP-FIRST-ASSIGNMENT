A commissure (/ˈkɒməʃər/) is the location at which two objects abut or are joined. The term is used especially in the fields of anatomy and biology.
In biology, the meeting of the two valves of a brachiopod or clam is a commissure; in botany, the term is used to denote the place where a fern's laterally expanded vein endings come together in a continuous marginal sorus.
