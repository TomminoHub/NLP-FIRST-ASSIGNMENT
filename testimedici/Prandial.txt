Prandial relates to a meal. Postprandial (from post prandium) means after eating a meal,[1][2] while preprandial is before a meal.[3]
The term postprandial is used in many contexts.
Refers to activities performed after a meal, such as drinking cocktails or smoking.
A common use is in relation to blood sugar (or blood glucose) levels, which are normally measured 2 hours after and before eating in a postprandial glucose test. This is because blood glucose levels usually rise after a meal. The American Diabetes Association recommends a postprandial glucose level under 180 mg/dl and a preprandial plasma glucose between 70 and 130 mg/dl.[4]
Other uses of postprandial include:
In the postprandium, there is digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by uptake and various metabolic processes, mainly anabolic ones (building organic molecules from smaller units). The postprandium is characterized by an increased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, putting the body in a state of "rest and digest".
