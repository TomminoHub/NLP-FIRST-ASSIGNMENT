Hypersalivation or hypersialosis is the excessive production of saliva.[3]  It has also been defined as increased amount of saliva in the mouth, which may also be caused by decreased clearance of saliva.[4]
Hypersalivation can contribute to drooling if there is an inability to keep the mouth closed or difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) the excess saliva, which can lead to excessive spitting.
Hypersalivation also often precedes emesis (vomiting), where it accompanies nausea (a feeling of needing to vomit).[5]
Conditions that can cause saliva overproduction include:[4]
Medications that can cause overproduction of saliva include:[4]
Substances that can cause hypersalivation include:[4]
Causes of decreased clearance of saliva include:[4]
Hypersalivation is optimally treated by treating or avoiding the underlying cause.[4] Mouthwash and tooth brushing may have drying effects.[4]
In the palliative care setting, anticholinergics and similar drugs that would normally reduce the production of saliva causing a dry mouth could be considered for symptom management:  scopolamine, atropine, propantheline, hyoscine, amitriptyline, glycopyrrolate.[9]
As of 2008, it is unclear if medication for people who have too much saliva due to clozapine treatment is useful.[10]
