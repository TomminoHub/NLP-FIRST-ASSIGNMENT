Confessions of a Sociopath: A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight is a 2013 book written by a female law professor under the pen name of M.E. Thomas, describing her up-and-down life as a sociopath.[1] The book describes sociopathy as a disorder that consists of a spectrum of behaviors, rather than the more simplistic stereotype of serial killers.[2] Thomas claims sociopathy helped her be a better lawyer,[3] and in an interview, she suggests that revealing herself in the book helps keep her in check: "Because there's that much pressure and scrutiny, I think I actually will be more successful in continuing to be a good member of society."[4] Lacking her own moral code, she relies on the teachings of her church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[5]
On her agent's advice, Thomas requested a psychological evaluation from John Edens, a psychology professor at Texas A&M University, before submitting her book for publication. After administering multiple tests, Edens concluded that Thomas is indeed a sociopath.[2]
The author later appeared in disguise on Dr. Phil discussing the subject.[6] Business Insider reported that Thomas' book made the idea of a "successful sociopath" mainstream.[7] A review in The New York Times described the book as "intermittingly gripping" and "a revelatory if contradictory muddle of a memoir".[8] Prospero, the books and arts column in The Economist, notes how the writing in the book clearly displays the characteristics of sociopathy: bombast, calculation, deceit, and charm.[9]
Actress Viola Davis said she prepared for her role of Amanda Waller in Suicide Squad by reading Confessions of a Sociopath.[10]
A one-hour dramedy, based on the book, is in development, starring and being co-written by Lisa Edelstein.[11]
