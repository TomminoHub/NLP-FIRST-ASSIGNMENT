Chromonychia is an abnormality in color of the substance or surface of the nail plate or subungual tissues.[1]: 658 
Chromonychia can be induced by antineoplastic drugs with few distinct forms, the most frequently seen is melanonychia.[2] Although a few cytostatics may cause these changes, the drugs most commonly involved are adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and vincristine, or in polychemotherapy[3][4]
Also chromonychia is associated with AIDS. A significant association (p<0.05) was found between chromonychia and CD4 counts of below 200 per cubic millimeter.[5]
