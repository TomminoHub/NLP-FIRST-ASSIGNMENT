Breast atrophy is the normal or spontaneous atrophy or shrinkage of the breasts.[1]
Breast atrophy commonly occurs in women during menopause when estrogen levels decrease.[2][3][4] It can also be caused by hypoestrogenism and/or hyperandrogenism in women in general,[1] such as in antiestrogen treatment for breast cancer, in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),[5][6] and in malnutrition such as that associated with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa or with chronic disease.[1][7][8] It can also be an effect of weight loss.[8][9]
In the treatment of gynecomastia in males and macromastia in women, and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for trans men,[10] breast atrophy may be a desired effect.
Examples of treatment options for breast atrophy, depending on the situation/when appropriate, can include estrogens, antiandrogens, and proper nutrition or weight gain.[citation needed]
