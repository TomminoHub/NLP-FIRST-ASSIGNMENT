Spongiosis is mainly intercellular[1] edema (abnormal accumulation of fluid) in the epidermis,[2] and is characteristic of eczematous dermatitis, manifested clinically by intraepidermal vesicles (fluid-containing spaces), "juicy" papules, and/or lichenification.[3] It is a severe case of eczema that affects the epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous skin tissues.[4] The three types of spongiotic dermatitis are acute, subacute and chronic.[4] A dermatologist can diagnose acute spongiotic dermatitis by examining the skin during an office visit, but a biopsy is needed for an accurate diagnosis of the type.[medical citation needed]
It can be caused by several internal or external factors, such as food, an insect bite, stress, medication or cosmetics. The treatment varies depending on the type and severity; it is normally treated with topical corticosteroid cream.[medical citation needed]
