Serpiginous, first known to be used in the 15th century, is a term from Latin serpere to creep, usually referring to a creeping, snakelike or slowly progressive skin disease.[1][2]
It is used to describe the rash in cutaneous larvae migrans,[3] erythema annulare centrifugum,[4] purpura annularis telangiectoides, ringworm,[5] balanitis circinata,[6] and some cases of bullous pemphigoid.[7]
It is also used to describe serpiginous choroiditis, a rare eye condition in which irregularly shaped (serpiginous) lesions are seen in two layers of the eye surface (the choriocapillaris and the retinal pigment epithelium).[8]
