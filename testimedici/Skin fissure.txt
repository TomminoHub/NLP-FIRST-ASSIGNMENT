A skin fissure is a cutaneous condition in which there is a linear-like cleavage of skin, sometimes defined as extending into the dermis.[1] It is smaller than a skin laceration.
A skin area on which there are many skin fissures is called cracked skin, and is most commonly a result of skin dryness. Ichthyosis is a genetic disorder where there is often severe skin cracking.
