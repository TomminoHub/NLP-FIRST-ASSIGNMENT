A lichenoid eruption is a skin disease characterized by damage and infiltration between the epidermis and dermis.[1]
Examples include lichen planus, lichen sclerosus and lichen nitidus. It can also be associated with abrasion or drug use.[2] It has been observed in conjunction with the use of proton pump inhibitors, and might be a sign and/or symptom of lupus such as subacute cutaneous lupus erythematous, according to the case reports and reviews.[3][4][5][6]
The term "lichenoid" derives from a resemblance to a lichen.
