The Thomas test is a physical examination test, named after the Welsh orthopaedic surgeon, Hugh Owen Thomas (1834â€“1891), to rule out hip flexion contracture (fixed partial flexion of the hip) and psoas syndrome (injury to the psoas muscle).   The test consists of 3 steps:
It is important to control the pelvic tilt to ensure that the Thomas test is valid for evaluating peak hip extension angle.[1]
If the iliopsoas muscle is shortened, or a contracture is present, the lower extremity on the involved side will be unable to fully extend at the hip. This constitutes a positive Thomas test.[2] Sometimes, with a very flexible patient, the Thomas test will be normal despite a psoas dysfunction being present. However, in the patient with a normal hip joint, a positive test is a good indicator of psoas hypertonicity.[2]
Other signs from the Thomas test: 
The hip flexion contracture is physiologic in the first 3 months of life and if it is absent in this period it may be a sign of developmental dysplasia of the hip. It is used to identify unilateral fixed flexion deformity of the hip.[3]
Psoas syndrome is often associated with runners, dancers, and gymnasts who complain of hip "stiffness" and reported "snapping" feeling when flexing at the waist.[4]
