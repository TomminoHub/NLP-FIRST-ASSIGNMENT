In medicine, agenesis (/eɪˈdʒɛnəsəs/[1]) refers to the failure of an organ to develop during embryonic growth and development due to the absence of primordial tissue. Many forms of agenesis are referred to by individual names, depending on the organ affected:
Eye agenesis is a medical condition in which people are born with no eyes.
Ear agenesis is a medical condition in which people are born without ears. 
Because the middle and inner ears are necessary for hearing, people with complete agenesis of the ears are totally deaf. Minor agenesis that affects only the visible parts of the outer ear, which may be called microtia, typically produces cosmetic concerns and perhaps hearing impairment if the opening to the ear canal is blocked, but not deafness.
