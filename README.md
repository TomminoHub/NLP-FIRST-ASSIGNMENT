Pipeline of the project in 'PIPELINE OF THE PROJECTS'
Git doesn't allow me to add empty folder.
In order to work, my code need 3 folder named respectively 'dizionario_Frequenze' 'dizionario_Occorrenze' and 'dizionario_da_classificare'.
I don't know why I can't add them, this is my first time using Git, if the code has some error I ask you to add these 3 folders.
