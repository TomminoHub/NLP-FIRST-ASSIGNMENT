A corrala is a type of housing found in old Madrid. Sometimes, it may be called a corridor house  due to blocks having doors located on corridors. Usually, it is wooden and the units look at the central area, or a patio. 
Most are found in dense and traditional neighborhoods and were built during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.[1]
Some of the blocks are even mentioned in books, like Fortunata y Jacinta. Other blocks can also be found in other Spanish cities, like Cádiz , Granada , Málaga , Seville, Valencia, Valladolid, etc. More cities include Vitoria and Santander and in various towns in Castilla y León and Castilla-La Mancha.[citation needed]
In South America, similar blocks are called Conventillos. Such examples include Santiago de Chile, Valparaíso,[2] Buenos Aires, and Montevideo.[3]
