5-over-1 or over-1s also known as a one-plus-five, or a podium building,[1] is a type of multi-family residential building commonly found in urban areas of North America.[2][3] The mid-rise buildings are normally constructed with four or five wood-frame stories above a concrete podium, usually for retail or resident amenity space. 
The name derives from the maximum permissible five floors of combustible construction (Type III or Type V) over a fire-resistive Type I podium of one floor for "5-over-1" or two floors for "5-over-2", as defined in the United States-based International Building Code (IBC) Section 510.2.[1][4] Some sources instead attribute the name to the wood framing of the upper construction; the International Building Code uses "Type V" to refer to non-fireproof structures, including those framed with dimensional lumber.[5][6]
The style of buildings originated with the work of architect Tim Smith in Los Angeles, who took advantage of a change in construction code allowing the use of fire-retardant treated wood (FRTW) to construct buildings up to five stories.[7][5] From this he saw that what became the "Five-Over-One" model would bring the construction costs down substantially, making a 100-unit affordable housing project financially viable.[5]
The style took root in New York and other dense cities in the American Northeast following the revisions in the 2000 IBC edition,[5] and it exploded in popularity in the 2010s, following a 2009 revision to IBC, which allowed up to five stories of wood-framed construction.[8]
The first recorded example of 5-over-1 construction is an affordable housing apartment building in Los Angeles built in 1996.[7] The wood-framed 5-over-1 style is popular due to its high density and relatively lower construction costs compared to steel and concrete.[9] 5-over-1 buildings often feature secure-access interior hallways with residential units on both sides, which favors a U, E, C, or right-angle building shape.[7] The exteriors of 5-over-1 buildings often contain flat windows, rainscreen cladding, and Hardie board cement fiber panels.[2]
These buildings are also sometimes called a Wrap or Texas Doughnut, which describes a multifamily building which is wrapped around a parking garage in the center.[10][11] This style is common in areas with higher parking mandates.[7]
The 5-over-1 style of buildings are often criticized for their high fire risk when under construction,[12] as well as their architectural blandness.[2][7][13] Some cities and jurisdictions have considered additional regulations for multi-story wood-framed structures. After an under construction apartment complex burned to the ground in downtown Waltham, Massachusetts in 2017, the city council voted 14-0 to request that the state reevaluate the building code for 5-over-1 buildings.[14] The borough of Edgewater, New Jersey, introduced a resolution calling on the state of New Jersey to enact stricter fire safety regulations for wood-framed buildings following a large fire that occurred in the wood-framed Avalon at Edgewater apartments in 2015.[15]
The 5-over-1 style of apartment buildings are also associated with gentrification, due to the popularity of the building style in neighborhoods affected by development-induced displacement. However, new housing at market rates (which may include 5-over-1-style buildings) has been shown to loosen the market for lower-quality housing, making it a possible anti-displacement tool.[16][17][18]
