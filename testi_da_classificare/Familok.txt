Familok is a type of multi-family house, originally designed for workers of industries and their families, mainly coal miners, built at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in the cities and towns of Silesia.
"Familok" is a Silesian way of pronouncing the original German name, Familien-Block (lit. family apartment house).
In several towns they are protected by conservationists and renovated due to their historical significance. Protected familoks include those in Nikiszowiec of Katowice, Kolonia Zgorzelec in Bytom, Kolonia Emma in Radlin, Ruda Śląska, cities situated in Silesia, and those situated in the Karviná District of Bohumin, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic, on the border with Silesia.
