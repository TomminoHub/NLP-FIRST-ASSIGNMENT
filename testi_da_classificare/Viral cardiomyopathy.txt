Viral cardiomyopathy occurs when viral infections cause myocarditis with a resulting thickening of the myocardium and dilation of the ventricles. These viruses include Coxsackie B and adenovirus, echoviruses, influenza H1N1, Epsteinâ€“Barr virus, rubella (German measles virus), varicella (chickenpox virus), mumps, measles, parvoviruses, yellow fever, dengue fever, polio, rabies and the viruses that cause hepatitis A and C,[2][3][4] as well as COVID-19,[5][6] which has been seen to cause this in persons otherwise thought to have a "low risk" of the virus's effects.[7]
Patients with Covid-19 frequently experience heart issues.[8] According to studies, people who have had previous cardiovascular conditions like cardiomyopathy, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or arrhythmia are more likely to become critically ill from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Myocarditis may result from a direct viral infection of the myocardium.[8] Cardiovascular biomarkers like troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity amino-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide, creatinine kinase, and creatinine kinase myocardial band, which indicate myocardial damage, increase in concentration in response to covid-19.[8] Hundreds of studies have reported myocarditis/myopericarditis caused by Covid-19 infection in living patients, with a male predominance (58%), and a median age of 50 years.
