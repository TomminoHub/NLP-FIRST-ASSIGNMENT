Autoimmune heart diseases are the effects of the body's own immune defense system mistaking cardiac antigens as foreign and attacking them leading to inflammation of the heart as a whole, or in parts. The commonest form of autoimmune heart disease is rheumatic heart disease or rheumatic fever.
Aetiologically, these are most commonly seen in children with a history of sore throat caused by a streptococcal infection. This is similar to the post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Here, the anti-bacterial antibodies cross react with the heart antigens causing inflammation.[citation needed]
Inflammatory damage leads to the following:[1][2]
These are the typical mechanisms of autoimmunity. Autoantibodies or auto-toxic T-lymphocyte mediated tissue destruction. The process is aided by neutrophils, the complement system, tumor necrosis factor alpha, etc.[citation needed]
These depend on the amount of inflammation. These are covered in their relevant articles.
Intensive cardiac care and immunosuppressives including corticosteroids are helpful in the acute stage of the disease. Colchicine can also be used to help prevent recurrences in Pericarditis. Chronic phase has, mainly debility control and supportive care options.
