Balinese traditional house refers to the traditional vernacular house of Balinese people in Bali, Indonesia. The Balinese traditional house is the product of a blend of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, fused with Austronesian animism, resulting in a house that is "in harmony" with the law of the cosmos of Balinese Hinduism.[1]
The Balinese traditional house is built as a house compound, where daily functions are separated not by rooms, but by individual structures within an enclosing wall.
