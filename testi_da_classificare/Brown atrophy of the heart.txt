Brown atrophy of the heart is atrophy of the heart muscle (or myocardium) commonly found in the elderly.[1][2] It is described as brown because fibers become pigmented by intracellular deposits (mostly around the cell nucleus) of lipofuscin,[1] a type of lipochrome granule.
It has no known effect on function,[1][2] and is described as being expected or normal in aging.[2]
Other types of brown atrophy include brown atrophy of neuronia and brown atrophy of the liver.[citation needed]
