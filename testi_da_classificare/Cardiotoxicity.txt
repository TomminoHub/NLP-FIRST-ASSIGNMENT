Cardiotoxicity is the occurrence of heart dysfunction as electric or muscle damage, resulting in heart toxicity.[1] The heart becomes weaker and is not as efficient in pumping blood. Cardiotoxicity may be caused by chemotherapy (a usual example is the class of anthracyclines)[2][3] treatment and/or radiotherapy;[4] complications from anorexia nervosa; adverse effects of heavy metals intake;[5] the long-term abuse of or ingestion at high doses of certain strong stimulants such as cocaine;[6] or an incorrectly administered drug such as bupivacaine.[7]
One of the ways to detect cardiotoxicity at early stages when there is a subclinical dysfunction is by measuring changes in regional function of the heart using strains.[citation needed]
