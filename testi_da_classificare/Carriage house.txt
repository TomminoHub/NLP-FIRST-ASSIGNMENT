A carriage house, also called a remise or coach house, is an outbuilding which was originally built to house horse-drawn carriages and the related tack.[1]
In Great Britain the farm building was called a cart shed.  These typically were open fronted, single story buildings, with the roof supported by regularly spaced pillars.[2]
They often face away from the farmyard and may be found close to the stables and roadways, giving direct access to the fields.[3][4]
In modern usage, the term "carriage house" has taken on several additional, somewhat overlapping meanings:
Carriage houses for small, city houses could be small, utilitarian, and only adequate to house one small carriage.  However, carriage houses for large estates could be quite elaborate and large enough to house many carriages, horses, tack, and hay.  They could even include basic living quarters for the staff who managed the horses and carriages.  Horses were occasionally stabled in the carriage house but usually in a separate barn or stable.
Because of the prestigious nature of some large, elaborate carriage houses, the term "Carriage House" is commonly used as part of the name of businesses such as antique shops and restaurants.  Sometimes these businesses are housed in former carriage houses. Property developers are now including coach houses in their portfolios. The unique architectural features and a great parking solution make it an attractive offering to many clients.[10]
