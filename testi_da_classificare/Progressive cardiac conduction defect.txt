Progressive cardiac conduction defect (PCCD) is a rare inherited degenerative disease of a heart's electrical conduction system. Over time PCCD can lead to a complete heart block and might require a pacemaker implantation to treat it.[2]
Most commonly PCCD is inherited as a autosomal dominant defect and is caused by mutations of chromosome 19q13.3 and in SCN5A, SCN1B and TRPM4 genes.[2][3]
