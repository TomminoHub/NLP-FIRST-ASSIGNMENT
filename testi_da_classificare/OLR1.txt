LOX-1 is the main receptor for oxidized LDL on endothelial cells, macrophages, smooth muscle cells,[7] and other cell types.[8] But minimally oxidized LDL is more readily recognized by the TLR4 receptor, and highly oxidized LDL is more readily recognized by the CD36 receptor.[9]
LOX-1 is a receptor protein which belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily. Its gene is regulated through the cyclic AMP signaling pathway. The protein binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized low-density lipoprotein.[citation needed]
Normally, LOX-1 expression on endothelial cells is low, but tumor necrosis factor alpha, oxidized LDL, blood vessel shear stress, and other atherosclerotic stimuli substantially increase LOX-1 expression.[8][10]
LOX-1 may be involved in the regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis.  Oxidized LDL induces endothelial cell apoptosis through LOX-1 binding.[7] Other ligands for LOX-1 include oxidized high-density lipoprotein, advanced glycation end-products, platelets, and apoptotic cells.[7][10]
The binding of platelets to LOX-1 causes a release of vasoconstrictive endothelin, which induces endothelial dysfunction.[10]
This protein may play a role as a scavenger receptor.[6]
Binding of oxidized LDL to LOX-1 activates NF-ÎºB, leading to monocyte adhesion to enthothelial cells (a pre-requisite for the macrophage foam cell formation of atherosclerosis).[8] Macrophage affinity for unmodified LDL particles is low, but is greatly increased when the LDL particles are oxidized.[11] LDL oxidation occurs in the sub-endothelial space, rather than in the circulation.[11] But oxidized cholesterol from foods cooked at high temperature can also be a source of oxysterols.[9]
Mutations of the OLR1 gene have been associated with atherosclerosis, risk of myocardial infarction, and may modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease.[6] When applied to human macrophage-derived foam cells in vitro, the dietary supplement berberine inhibits the expression of the ORL1 gene in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,[12] but this has not yet been demonstrated in a living animal or human.[citation needed]
