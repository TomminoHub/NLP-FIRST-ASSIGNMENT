Embryocardia is a condition in which S1 and S2 (the two heart sounds that produce the typical "lubb-dubb" sound of the heart) become indistinguishable and equally spaced.[1] Thus the normal "lubb-dubb" rhythm of the heart becomes a "tic-toc" rhythm resembling the heart sounds of a fetus. This indicates a serious loss of natural fluctuation and often precedes a fatal collapse.[2][3] This condition is observed in myocarditis.[4]
