The Koons House is a historic house at 409 Fifth Street NW in Bentonville, Arkansas.  It is an unusually high-quality and well-preserved example of a once-common local vernacular form called the "gumdrop duple", a two-family residence with a pyramidal roof.  The front facade has a single-story hip-roofed porch supported by tapered square columns, and there is a shed-roof addition across the rear.  The roof is not fully pyramidal, having small gable sections near the peak that provide ventilation.  The house was built c. 1908, and is a slightly larger version of the traditional form.[2]
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[1]
